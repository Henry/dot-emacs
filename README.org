#+TITLE:     *Emacs packages, extensions, configuration and image dump scripts*

This is the contents of my /.emacs.d/ directory.

* Emacs Version
  + For GNU Emacs 25.1.3

* Building eemacs (fast-loading extended emacs)
  I use such an extensive set of packages and configurations that loading them
  at run-time in the normal manner is prohibitively slow.  To avoid this problem
  I build and dump an image of =emacs= containing nearly all of the packages and
  configuration files as =eemacs=.  The script to perform this task is
  =bin/makeEemacs= based on various sources of information on the =emacs dump=
  function, in particular [[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/DumpingEmacs][dumping emacs]].  Note that =emacs= no longer supports
  dumping new images and =temacs= must be used which is obtained by compiling
  =emacs= from sources.  I hope that eventually the option to dump =emacs=
  images directly from =emacs= will be reinstated.
