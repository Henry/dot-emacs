This is the contents of my /.emacs.d/ directory.

Many of the code snippets and ideas collated here were obtained originally from
the [[http://www.emacswiki.org][EmacsWiki]] and I am indebted to all those who contribute to this excellent
resource.

* Emacs Version
  + For GNU Emacs 24.3.1
  + May work with GNU Emacs 24.? but not earlier versions.

* Building eemacs (fast-loading extended emacs)
  I use such an extensive set of packages and configurations that loading
  them at run-time in the normal manner is prohibitively slow.  To avoid this
  problem I build and dump an image of =emacs= containing nearly all of the
  packages and configuration files as =eemacs=.  The script to perform this task
  is =bin/makeEemacs= based on various sources of information on the =emacs
  dump= function, in particular [[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/DumpingEmacs][dumping emacs]].

* My Packages (in /my-lisp/ directory)

* Other Packages without permanent home (in /my-lisp/ directory)
  + ectags
  + em-last
  + file-journal (This is already on GitHub)
  + git-grep
  + rw-acronyms
  + xl

* Third-party Packages (in the /packages/ and /lisp/ directories)
  A set of scripts are provided to download, update, and compile all the
  major third-party packages I use.  In the /packages/bin/ directory:
  + =getAll=: Get all the packages from their respective repositories
  + =getDoremi=: Get the =doremi= package from the Emacs Wiki
  + =getIcicles=: Get the =icicles= package from the Emacs Wiki
  + =getWl=: Get =wanderlust= and associated packages
  + =updateAll=: Update all the packages from their respective repositories
  + =makeDirs=: Helper script for =Allmake=
  + =Allmake=: build all the packages
  In addition a =Makefile= is provided in the /lisp/ directory to compile the
  minor packages.
