;; This file makes it easier to use multiple shells within emacs. Features:
;;
;; multi-eshell -- Creates a NEW shell, even if one already exists.
;; multi-eshell-switch -- If not in a shell buffer, return to the last EXISTING
;;                        shell buffer. Otherwise, switch to the next buffer in
;;                        the shell ring.
;; multi-eshell-go-back -- Switch to the previous buffer in the shell ring.
;;
;; The customizable function multi-eshell-shell-function is user customizable, and lets the user
;; pick the particular shell to use (e.g. *ansi-term*, *shell*, *eshell*, etc).
