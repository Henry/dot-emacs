;;; Commentary:
(defgroup file-journal '()
  "Filejournal keeps a list of all the files you have visited, like
a persistent most-recently viewed list.  You can control the number
of days to keep the journal for.  Additionally you can set some
files to not be on the list.

Work with files as usual and use M-x fj-show to revisit them later
by date.

")

;;; Changelog:
;; v 0.1 - First release by Tamas
;; v 0.2 - Changes by Jonathan Arkell
;;       - Minor fixes to allow for vars to be customizeable
;;       - Added an exclusion list
;; v 0.3 - Added a timer that saves the journal once an hour.
;;       - Added a code to refresh the *file-journal* buffer
;;         when a new file is visited.
;; v 0.4 - Small optimization to make the exclusion not suck
;;       - Integration with anything

;; TODO:
;; - Hook into, or replace ECBs previous files list.
;; - Open region
;; - Keep a list of the times that the file has been accessed, so
;;   a list of favorite files can be built.


;; Tested on Emacs 22.
