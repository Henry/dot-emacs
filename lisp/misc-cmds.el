;;; Change log:
;;
;; 2008/05/23 dadams
;;     Moved to new library second-sel.el:
;;       primary-to-secondary, rotate-secondary-selection-yank-pointer,
;;       secondary-to-primary, yank-pop(-commands|secondary), yank-undo-function,
;;       current-secondary-selection,  yank-secondary(-or-swap-w-region),
;;       secondary-selection(-ring(-max|-yank-pointer)), add-secondary-to-ring,
;;       mouse-drag-secondary, mouse-secondary-save-then-kill.
;; 2008/05/22 dadams
;;     Added: secondary-selection(-ring(-max|-yank-pointer)), yank-undo-function,
;;            rotate-secondary-selection-yank-pointer, current-secondary-selection,
;;            add-secondary-to-ring, yank-pop-(commands|secondary).
;;     yank-secondary: Added optional arg - use current-secondary-selection.
;;                     Use insert-for-yank.
;;     primary-to-secondary: Use add-secondary-to-ring, filter-buffer-substring.
;;                           Delay setting this-command.  Exchange point and mark.
;;                           Return nil.
;;     Disable browse-kill-ring's advice.
;; 2008/05/06 dadams
;;     Renamed: yank-secondary-or-convert-primary to yank-secondary-or-swap-w-region.
;;     yank-secondary-or-swap-w-region: Prefix arg < 0 means secondary-to-primary.
;;     primary-to-secondary: Overlay uses current buffer.
;; 2008/05/03 dadams
;;     (put 'yank-secondary 'delete-selection 'yank).
;;     Added: primary-to-secondary, secondary-to-primary,
;;            yank-secondary-or-convert-primary.
;; 2008/03/02 dadams
;;     describe-file: Use default dir if arg is nil.
;;                    Removed "icicle" typos. Removed save-excursion.
;;     Moved describe-file to help+20.el and help-fns+.el.
;; 2008/01/23 dadams
;;     goto-longest-line: Fix to work with narrowed buffer.
;;       Allow empty region, so can just search forward directly.
;;       If point at end of region, exchange with mark.
;;       If end is before beg, swap them.
;;       If only 1 line in region, give "Only..." msg, flash, and deactivate mark.
;;       Don't stop while loop just because mark is inactive.
;;       Go to target relative to point-min, not to absolute line nb, in case narrowed.
;;       Highlight current line (Emacs 22).
;;     Removed: region-or-buffer-limits.
;; 2007-11-14
;;     Rewrote recenter-top-bottom to combine the best of -1 and -2.
;; 2007/11/11 dadams
;;     recenter-top-bottom: Rewrote to base destination on current window position.
;;     Renamed original recenter-top-bottom to recenter-top-bottom-bis, and added
;;       treatment of scroll-conservatively.

current line.  That longest line could be before or after the current
