;;; Commentary:

;; color-occur highlight occur buffer and file buffer. Furthermore
;; color-occur show the matching line of file buffer in other window.

;;; Install:

;; Put this file into load-path'ed directory, and byte compile it if

;; Usage:
;; occur <regexp> shows all occurrences of <regexp> in current buffers
;; C-c C-c or RET gets you to the occurrence
;; q : quit
;; <up>, n : next matches
