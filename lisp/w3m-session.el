;; INTRODUCTION:
;;
;; w3m-session provides persistent emacs-w3m browsing sessions. When
;; quitting w3m (or, if you request it, at any other time while using
;; it) you can save the current w3m session (that is, the set of open
;; tabs and the URLs they're visiting). Upon restarting emacs-w3m
;; (possibly after restarting Emacs itself) you'll have the possibity
;; of recovering the saved session (that is, of re-opening the saved
;; tabs and URLs). You also have at your disposal a command to recover
;; the saved session at any other time.
;;
;; INSTALLATION:
;;
;; Just put this file somewhere on your Emacs load path and add the
;; following line to your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (require 'w3m-session)
;;
;; After restarting Emacs (or evaluating the form above), each time
;; you start emacs-w3m with 'w3m' you'll get a prompt asking whether
;; your last browsing session should be loaded. Likewise, when
;; quitting the browser, you'll have the possibility of saving your
;; current session (overwriting the previous one).
;;
;; In addition, two new interactive functions are defined:
;;
;;   w3m-session-load  --  load the last stored session
;;   w3m-session-save  --  save the current session
;;
;; These functions can be invoked at any time while running emacs-w3m.
;; Optionally, you can bind them to key shortcuts with the proper
;; variations of the following elisp magic in your .emacs:
;;  (defun w3m-add-keys ()
;;    (define-key w3m-mode-map "S" 'w3m-session-save)
;;    (define-key w3m-mode-map "L" 'w3m-session-load))
;;  (add-hook 'w3m-mode-hook 'w3m-add-keys)
;;
;; CUSTOMIZATION:
;;
;; A new customization group, w3m-session, is available. There you can
;; customize the following variables:
;;
;;   w3m-session-load-always     -- if t, `w3m-session-load' will *not* ask
;;                                for confirmation (default nil)
;;   w3m-session-save-always     -- if t, `w3m-session-load' will *not* ask
;;                                for confirmation (default nil)
;;   w3m-session-show-titles     -- if t, the load prompt will list the
;;                                session URL titles (default t)
;;   w3m-session-duplicate-tabs  -- what to do when loading a session that
;;                                contains a URL already open
;;   w3m-session-file            -- the file where w3m session info
;;                                is stored (default "~/.w3m-session")
;;   w3m-session-autosave-period -- the period, in seconds, for automatic
;;                                session backup file updating.
;;
;;
;; You can also customize them in your .emacs file, to wit:
;;
;;   (setq w3m-session-file "~/.emacs.d/w3m-session")
;;   (setq w3m-session-save-always nil)
;;   (setq w3m-session-load-always nil)
;;   (setq w3m-session-show-titles t)
;;   (setq w3m-session-duplicate-tabs 'ask) ;  'never, 'always, 'ask
;;
;; HISTORY:
;;
;;   Version 0.3.5 (Sun Jan 14, 2007):
;;
;;     - automatic session backup every `w3m-session-autosave-period'
;;       seconds.
;;
;;   Version 0.3.4 (Wed Jul 19, 2006):
;;
;;     - save session file on quitting Emacs (without using
;;       desktop.el)
;;
;;   Version 0.3.3 (Thu Jun  8, 2006):
;;
;;     - save session file with pretty print.
;;     - handle correctly multiple emacs-w3m (re)starts during a
;;       single emacs session.
;;     - save URLs in hexified form to allow & in them.
;;     - code cleanup.
;;
;;   Version 0.3.2 (Mon Sep 29, 2003):
;;
;;     - bug fix: when searching or going to home/bookmarks/etc,
;;       keep the current tab's focus.
;;
;;   Version 0.3.1 (Tue Aug 26, 2003):
;;
;;     - type of `w3m-session-file' set to 'file' in customisation
;;       buffer.
;;     - bug fix: syntax error due to a typo in `w3m-session-file'
;;
;;   Version 0.3 (Mon Aug 25, 2003):
;;
;;     - the load session tab lists the titles of the session's pages
;;       (customizable via 'w3m-session-show-titles').
;;     - the duplicated tab prompt displays also the URL's title.
;;     - bug fix: active tab in session now is correctly saved.
;;
;;   Version 0.2 (Fri Aug 22, 2003):
;;
;;     - the session info now includes the active tab, which gets
;;       displayed when the session is reloaded.
;;     - when reloading a session in a running emacs-w3m, if the
;;       session contains a URL that is already being displayed by the
;;       browser, the tab can be reused or duplicated (customizable
;;       via `w3m-session-duplicate-tabs').
;;
;;   Version 0.1 (Wed Aug 20, 2003) -- Initial release.
