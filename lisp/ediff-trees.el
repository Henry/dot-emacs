;;; Commentary:

;; The ediff-trees package is a simple frontend to the emacs' ediff
;; package to allow a simpler comparison of two similar directory
;; trees.

;; I wrote this package because I often need to compare two different
;; versions of the same directory tree and ediff-directories is not
;; very helpful in this case.  Specially when the directory trees to
;; compare are deep and only a few files have changed.
;; Typically, that occurs when I create a copy of some project
;; directory tree either to make some experiments myself or to send to
;; someone else that will return a modified directory tree to me
;; later.  (Yes, I heard of version control systems, and I use them
;; regularly.  Yet, for several reasons, sometimes that is not an
;; option.)

;; Later, when I want to integrate the modified directory tree with
;; the original tree, I want to see the differences to the original
;; version, so that I may decide whether to accept the changes or not.
;; This is where this package kicks in...

;; To use it, just call `ediff-trees', which will ask for two
;; directories to compare.  Usually, I give the original directory as
;; the first one and the modified directory as the second one.

;; ediff-trees recursively descends both directories, collecting the
;; pairs of files that are worth "comparing": either files that
;; changed, or that appear in one of the two directory trees but not
;; in the other.  Then, it shows the first "change" using ediff.

;; In fact, ediff-trees either uses ediff to compare a file with its
;; changed version, or simply opens a file that occurs in only one of
;; the trees.

;; The user can then navigate backward and forward in the set of
;; changes by using `ediff-trees-examine-next' and
;; `ediff-trees-examine-previous', respectively.  These functions move
;; from one change (quiting the current ediff session or killing the
;; current file buffer) to another.  Therefore, by repeatedly using
;; these functions we can go through all the changes.  I usually use
;; some global bindings for these functions.  Something like this:
;;
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "s-SPC") 'ediff-trees-examine-next)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "S-s-SPC") 'ediff-trees-examine-previous)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-s-SPC") 'ediff-trees-examine-next-regexp)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-s-SPC") 'ediff-trees-examine-previous-regexp))

;; The `ediff-trees-examine-next-regexp' and
;; `ediff-trees-examine-previous-regexp' skip over the list of changes
;; to a file with a filename that matches a given regexp.

;; This package allows for some customization.  Please, see the
;; ediff-trees group under customize.

;; Finally, to deal with small changes in the white space I often find
;; it useful to configure ediff like this:
;;
;;   (setq ediff-diff-options "-w")
;;   (setq-default ediff-ignore-similar-regions t)
