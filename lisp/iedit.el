;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a more intuitive way of replace-string operation:
;; - Mark the contents in the buffer
;; - Start iedit minor mode - by press C-;
;;   All of the same contents in the buffer are highlighted
;; - Edit one of the contents
;;   The change is applied to other contents simultaneously
;; - Finish - by pressing C-; again
;;
;; So I call it in-place "replace-string".
;; 
;;; Suggested key bindings:
;;
;; (define-key global-map (kbd "C-;") 'iedit-mode)
;;
;; todo:
;; - Start from isearch
;; - Use symbol at current point by default
;; - Toggle displaying lines except lines contains matches
;; - Adjust region when iedit mode is active
;; - Lazy highlight feature (from isearch)
;; - Help information
;; 
;; Change log:
;;
;; 2010/01/25 Disable updating other regions when undo-in-progress since they
;;            are already updated by undo
;;
