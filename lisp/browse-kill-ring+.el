;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Extensions to `browse-kill-ring.el'.
;;
;;  Put this in your init file (~/.emacs):
;;
;;    (require 'browse-kill-ring+)
;;
;;
;;  Option `browse-kill-ring-alternative-ring' is an alternative
;;  selection ring to use, in addition to the `kill-ring'.  You can
;;  customize the value to any ring of strings you like.
;;
;;  `browse-kill-ring' lets you use either ring as the selection ring
;;  to browse and paste.  You can even use both rings, in different
;;  `browse-kill-ring' display buffers.  In such a buffer (in
;;  `browse-kill-ring-mode'), `o' pops to the list for the other ring.
;;
;;  If you have library `second-sel.el' in your `load-path'
;;  (recommended) it is loaded automatically when you load
;;  `browse-kill-ring+.el'.  In this case, by default
;;  `browse-kill-ring-alternative-ring' is the secondary selection
;;  ring.
;;
;;  You can customize the set of commands to be recognized as yank
;;  commands and alternative yank commands - see options
;;  `browse-kill-ring-yank-commands' and
;;  `browse-kill-ring-alternative-yank-commands'.  The alternative
;;  yank commands are commands that yank using a different selection
;;  ring, for example, the secondary yank commands defined by library
;;  `second-sel.el'.
;;
;;  Following a yank command or alternative yank command, `M-y' pops
;;  and yanks the appropriate type of selection.  A prefix arg N
;;  chooses the Nth previous selection in the ring.
;;
;;  Otherwise (not following a yank or alternative yank), `M-y'
;;  browses the current selection ring.  A prefix arg switches to the
;;  other selection ring.  If you are in a `browse-kill-ring' buffer,
;;  then `M-y' switches to the other ring even without a prefix arg.
;;
;;  If there is no alternative selection ring (e.g., you do not use
;;  library `second-sel.el'), then `M-y' either pops (following a
;;  yank) or browses (not following a yank) the `kill-ring'.
;;
;;  FWIW, I customize `browse-kill-ring-quit-action' to be
;;  `browse-kill-ring-quit-deletes-window/frame'.  This is similar to
;;  the default behavior, except that if the window is dedicated, then
;;  the frame is deleted.
;;
;;  Icicles offers an alternative: completion vs browsing.
;;
;;    You might want to use the Icicles (library `icicles.el') binding
;;    of `M-y' as an alternative to the `browse-kill-ring+.el'
;;    behavior of `M-y'.  If you do that you can of course still use
;;    `browse-kill-ring+.el' to browse the selection rings.  Just bind
;;    `browse-kill-ring'.
;;
;;    What Icicles offers is the ability to yank by completing against
;;    the selection rings, instead of browsing them.
;;
;;
;;  Commands defined here:
;;
;;    `browse-kill-ring-copy-to-other-ring',
;;    `browse-kill-ring-switch-to-other-kill-ring',
;;    `toggle-browse-kill-ring-display-style'.
;;
;;  User options defined here:
;;
;;    `browse-kill-ring-alternative-push-function',
;;    `browse-kill-ring-alternative-ring',
;;    `browse-kill-ring-alternative-yank-commands',
;;    `browse-kill-ring-yank-commands'.
;;
;;  Non-interactive functions defined here:
;;
;;    `browse-kill-ring-current-ring',
;;    `browse-kill-ring-quit-deletes-window/frame',
;;    `browse-kill-ring-remove-dups',
;;    `browse-kill-ring-target-overlay-at'.
;;
;;  Internal variables defined here:
;;
;;    `browse-kill-ring-current-ring', `browse-kill-ring-mode-map'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `browse-kill-ring.el'
;;              have been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;    `browse-kill-ring', `browse-kill-ring-append-insert-and-move',
;;    `browse-kill-ring-current-string',
;;    `browse-kill-ring-default-keybindings',
;;    `browse-kill-ring-delete', `browse-kill-ring-do-append-insert',
;;    `browse-kill-ring-do-insert',
;;    `browse-kill-ring-insert-and-move',
;;    `browse-kill-ring-do-prepend-insert', `browse-kill-ring-edit',
;;    `browse-kill-ring-edit-finish', `browse-kill-ring-forward',
;;    `browse-kill-ring-prepend-insert-and-move',
;;    `browse-kill-ring-mode' `browse-kill-ring-setup'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `second-sel.el'
;;              have been ADVISED HERE:
;;
;;    `add-secondary-to-ring'.
;;
;;  Key bindings defined here for `browse-kill-ring-mode-map':
;;
;;     `t'     - `toggle-browse-kill-ring-display-style'
;;     `TAB'   - `browse-kill-ring-forward'
;;     `S-TAB' - `browse-kill-ring-previous'
;;
;;  NOTE: This library automatically calls
;;  `browse-kill-ring-default-keybindings'.  If you do not want that,
;;  then comment out this call (at the end of the file).
;;
;;
;;  TO DO:
;;
;;  `browse-kill-ring-edit': membership of selection text is not
;;  sufficient, since there can be duplicates.

;;
;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 2012/02/08 dadams
;;     browse-kill-ring-remove-dups: Redefined to use a hash table.
;; 2012/01/15 dadams
;;     browse-kill-ring-mode: Call font-lock-refresh-defaults.

;;     browse-kill-ring, *-delete, *-insert-and-move, *-mode, *-edit(-finish), *-setup:
;;       Use the function, not the var, browse-kill-ring-current-ring.
;; 2011/12/23 dadams
;;     browse-kill-ring-do-insert: Delete active region before inserting, if in delete-seletion-mode.
;; 2011/03/22 dadams
;;     Added: browse-kill-ring(-append|-prepend)-insert-and-move,
;;            browse-kill-ring-alternative-push-function.
