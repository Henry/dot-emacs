;;
;; Set up your prefered keys for dired and globals as usual
;;
;; Here is my config with version-1.16:
;; ===================================

;;  `traverse-search-in-dired-dir-at-point'
;;    Launch `traverse-deep-rfind' from `dired-mode'
;;  `traverse-dired-browse-archive'
;;    This function use AVFS and FUSE, so be sure
;;  `traverse-dired-search-in-archive'

;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;
;;  `traverse-ignore-files'
;;    Files we want to ignore.
;;    default = (quote (".elc" ".pyc" ".orig" ".bz2" ".gz" ...))

;; You can use customize to set some variables : (eval with C-x C-e)
;; (customize-group "traversedir")

;; Usage:
;; =====
;; M-x `traverse-deep-rfind'
;; When searching is done and you are in traverse buffer
;; some interactive actions are provided for navigate and for replacing regexps
;; Use "C-h m" for more info while in traverse-buffer.

;; You can also use traverse from DIRED:
;; M-x `traverse-dired-search-regexp-in-anything-at-point'
;; This function work on directory, files, (1)compressed files (AVFS)
;; and marked files:
;; If you have marked files search will be performed on these files.
;; If no files are marked, traverse will search in element at point
;; with appropriate function.
;; However, you can use specialized functions, check this file to see all
;; the interactives functions.
;;
;; M-x `traverse-dired-find-in-all-files'
;; Search in all regular files in the current dired buffer
;;
;; M-x `traverse-occur-current-buffer'
;; Just like occur but you can navigate and replace regexp.
;;
;; M-x `traverse-dired-browse-archive'
;; This function use (1)AVFS to browse archive tar.gz, bz2 etc..
;; Other functions are provided:
;; `traverse-cp-or-mv-extfiles-in-dir'
;; `traverse-build-tags-in-project'
;;
;; (1)NOTE: You have to install AVFS and enable fuse in your kernel if
;; you want to browse and search in archives.
;; Please see the doc of your distrib.
;; and the doc of AVFS
;; http://sourceforge.net/projects/avf
;; If you don't want to use AVFS in traverse, set `traverse-use-avfs'
;; to nil (or do nothing because it's the default)
;; 
;; You can also use traverselisp.el in anything.el with the appropriate sources:
