;;; Commentary:

;;; dired-tar adds a command to dired-mode for creating and unpacking
;;; tar files.  When using this package, typing `T' on a tar file in a
;;; dired listing unpacks the tar file, uncompressing it if necessary.
;;; Typing `T' on a directory packs up that directory into a gzipped
;;; tar file named DIRNAME.tar.gz.
;;;
;;; To use this package, just place it in a directory in your Emacs
;;; lisp load path, byte-compile it, and put the line
;;;    (require 'dired-tar)
;;; in your .emacs.
;;;
;;; This file defines the following function:
;;;
;;; dired-tar-pack-unpack - If the file on the current line is a tar
;;;    file, or a gzipped or compressed tar file, unpack it.  If the
;;;    file on the current line is a directory, build a tar file for
;;;    it, and gzip it.
;;;
;;; It also declares the following variables:
;;;
;;; dired-tar-should-gzip - if t, dired-tar-pack gzips the tar files
;;;	it creates.  If nil, dired-tar-pack leaves the tars alone.
;;;
;;; dired-tar-command-switches - flags to pass to the tar program.
;;;      This is concatenated with command characters ("x" or "c" or
;;;      whatever).  The default is 'vf'; I'm told Windows users
;;;      should use "mvf".
;;;
;;; dired-tar-gzip-extension - extension to use for gzipped tar files.
;;;      Defaults to ".tar.gz", but ".tgz" may be a useful value in
;;;      some circumstances.
;;;
;;; dired-tar-gzip-command - a shell command which gzips its
;;;     standard input to its standard output.
;;;
;;; dired-tar-ungzip-command - a shell command which ungzips
;;;	its standard input to its standard output.
;;;
;;; dired-tar-shell-file-name - name of the shell to use to run the
;;;      tar command.  The default is /bin/sh, which should work for
;;;	 all Unix users, better than your login shell; I'm told
;;;	 Windows users may want to use "4NT", but I know nothing about
;;;	 Windows.

;;; Changes since 1.6:
;;; - recognize files with extension .tgz as gzipped tarfiles; let user
;;;   configure what we name compressed tar files we create.
;;; Changes since 1.5:
;;; - (dired-tar-pack): Changes from Cord Kielhorn: name files correctly
;;;   when dired-tar-should-gzip is false.
;;;
;;; Changes since 1.4:
;;; - added dired-tar-shell-file-name and dired-tar-command-switches;
;;;   thanks to Cristian Ionescu-Idbohrn <cii@kcs.se>!
