;;; Commentary:

;; Provides a mode where paragraphs are refilled after changes in them
;; (using `after-change-hooks').  This gives something akin to typical
;; word processor-style filling.  We restrict refilling due to
;; self-insertion to the characters which trigger auto-fill.

;; It partly satisfies a todo item in enriched.el for some value of
;; `without slowing down editing too much'.  It doesn't attempt to do
;; anything (using `window-size-change-functions'?) about resizing
;; windows -- who cares?

;; This implementation is probably fragile and missing some special
;; cases -- not extensively tested.  Yanking paragraph breaks, for
;; instance, won't DTRT by refilling all the relevant paragraphs.

;; You could do it a bit more efficiently (and robustly?) with just an
;; auto-fill function, but that doesn't cope with changes other than
;; through self-insertion.  (Using auto-fill and after-change
;; functions together didn't seem winning.)  This could probably
;; benefit from a less-general and faster `fill-paragraph-function',
;; ideally as a primitive, but I doubt we'll implement that.

;; The work is done in a local post-command hook but only if
;; `refill-doit' has been set by the after-change function.  Using
;; `post-command-hooks' ensures simply that refilling only happens
;; once per command.

;; [Per Abrahamsen's maniac.el does a similar thing, but operates from
;; post-command-hook.  I don't understand the statement in it that
;; after-change-hooks don't work for this purpose; perhaps there was
;; some Emacs bug at the time.  ISTR maniac has problems with
;; whitespace at the end of paragraphs.]

;;; Code:

(defun refill-fill-paragraph (arg)
  "Like `fill-paragraph' but don't delete whitespace at paragraph end."
  ;; Should probably use a text property indicating previously-filled
  ;; stuff to avoid filling before the point of change.
