;;; Commentary:
;;
;; When moving the cursor (with e.g. the arrow keys or C-n, C-p, etc) and the
;; key is held down and auto-repeated, then start moving cursor in increasingly
;; larger steps.
;;
;; Any command that takes a numeric argument as its first arg (specified
;; by e.g. (interactive "p")) can be accelerated. But it is mostly only useful
;; to accelerate cursor movement commands that normally move cursor a short
;; distance.
;;
;; The feature is disabled when recording (and executing) keyboard macros,
;; because timing information is not stored in macros.
;;
;; Example
;;
;;  (require 'accelerate)
;;  (accelerate previous-line 2)
;;  (accelerate next-line 2)
;;  (accelerate backward-char 3)
;;  (accelerate forward-char 3)
;;  (accelerate dired-previous-line 2)
;;  (accelerate dired-next-line 2)
;;  (accelerate speedbar-prev 2)
;;  (accelerate speedbar-next 2)
;;
;; (Whether the command being accelerated is defined yet or not does not matter.
;;  E.g. when accelerating dired-next-line, (require 'dired) is not needed.)
;;
;; TODO: Problem accelerating backward-char and forward-char; defadvice does not
;;       take effect. (Is it because they are subs, and not functions?)
;;
;; TODO: Doesn't work with multiple-cursors.
