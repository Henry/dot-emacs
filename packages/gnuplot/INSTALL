	
To install gnuplot-mode:
	
1. At the command line:

      > configure
      > make

   If you use XEmacs, do "make EMACS=xemacs" (or change the EMACS
   variable to "xemacs" in the Makefile, the run "make").

   If "configure" doesn't work for you, the file "Makefile.dst" can be
   used.  In that case do, "make -f Makefile.dst".

2. Move the .elc files to a place where emacs can find them, for
   example /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp or your personal emacs
   directory.

3. Insert the contents of the `dotemacs' file into your .emacs file
   or system start-up file to enable gnuplot mode.

4. The function `gnuplot-info-lookup-symbol' looks at the Gnuplot
   info file that comes with this package or that can be made from
   the Gnuplot distribution.  For that function to work, the file
   gnuplot.info must be placed somewhere where info can find it, for
   example /usr/info.  A line like this in your .emacs allows you to
   put gnuplot.info any place convenient:
     (add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list "/path/to/file")



The "configure; make" sequence may not work on all systems,
particularly Win32 systems.  The long-winded way of making the .elc
gpelcard.ps files is to edit each of the .el files with emacs and do
`M-x byte-compile-file'.  Then "latex gpelcard.tex" and
"dvips gpelcard.dvi".

You will need to follow the instructions contained in the file
Win9x/INSTALL.Win9x to get gnuplot working with Emacs on a Windows 95
or 98 machine.
