	* gnuplot.el: Version 0.4
	* Added info-look to distribution.  It was taken from the emacs
	  20.2 installation and one small change was made to allow
	  it compile under XEmacs.
	* Use info-look for info interface.  With this the gnuplot-mode
       	  user interface to the gnuplot info file does not change
	  but the interior code is much cleaner and I get to use an
	  already invented wheel.  One nice feature is that the help
	  function is completely independent of the version number of
	  gnuplot as long as the index in the gnuplot.info file is
	  called "General Index".  Also `gnuplot-keywords' (which is
	  used for help, keyword-completion, and hilit19 highlighting)
	  is now generated automatically the first time gnuplot mode
	  is invoked.
	* Changed default of `gnuplot-show-help-flag' to nil.
