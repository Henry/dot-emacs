<h3 class="section">3.3 Semantic indentation</h3>

<p><acronym>SLIME</acronym> automatically discovers how to indent the macros in your Lisp
system. To do this the Lisp side scans all the macros in the system and
reports to Emacs all the ones with <code>&amp;body</code> arguments. Emacs then
indents these specially, putting the first arguments four spaces in and
the &ldquo;body&rdquo; arguments just two spaces, as usual.

   <p>This should &ldquo;just work.&rdquo; If you are a lucky sort of person you needn't
read the rest of this section.

   <p>To simplify the implementation, <acronym>SLIME</acronym> doesn't distinguish between
macros with the same symbol-name but different packages. This makes it
fit nicely with Emacs's indentation code. However, if you do have
several macros with the same symbol-name then they will all be indented
the same way, arbitrarily using the style from one of their
arglists. You can find out which symbols are involved in collisions
with:

<pre class="example">     (swank:print-indentation-lossage)
</pre>
   <p>If a collision causes you irritation, don't have a nervous breakdown,
just override the Elisp symbol's <code>common-lisp-indent-function</code>
property to your taste. <acronym>SLIME</acronym> won't override your custom settings, it
just tries to give you good defaults.

   <p>A more subtle issue is that imperfect caching is used for the sake of
performance. <a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

   <p>In an ideal world, Lisp would automatically scan every symbol for
indentation changes after each command from Emacs. However, this is too
expensive to do every time. Instead Lisp usually just scans the symbols
whose home package matches the one used by the Emacs buffer where the
request comes from. That is sufficient to pick up the indentation of
most interactively-defined macros. To catch the rest we make a full scan
of every symbol each time a new Lisp package is created between commands
&ndash; that takes care of things like new systems being loaded.

   <p>You can use <kbd>M-x slime-update-indentation</kbd> to force all symbols to
be scanned for indentation information.
