;;; Commentary:

;; Org-Babel support for evaluating ditaa source code.
;;
;; This differs from most standard languages in that
;;
;; 1) there is no such thing as a "session" in ditaa
;;
;; 2) we are generally only going to return results of type "file"
;;
;; 3) we are adding the "file" and "cmdline" header arguments
;;
;; 4) there are no variables (at least for now)

;;; Code:
(require 'ob)

(defvar org-babel-default-header-args:ditaa
  '((:results . "file") (:exports . "results"))
  "Default arguments for evaluating a ditaa source block.")

(defvar org-ditaa-jar-path)
(defun org-babel-execute:ditaa (body params)
  "Execute a block of Ditaa code with org-babel.
This function is called by `org-babel-execute-src-block'."
  (let* ((result-params (split-string (or (cdr (assoc :results params)) "")))
	 (out-file ((lambda (el)
		      (or el
			  (error
			   "ditaa code block requires :file header argument")))
		    (cdr (assoc :file params))))
	 (cmdline (cdr (assoc :cmdline params)))
	 (in-file (org-babel-temp-file "ditaa-"))
	 (cmd (concat "java -jar "
		      (shell-quote-argument
		       (expand-file-name org-ditaa-jar-path))
		      " " cmdline
		      " " (org-babel-process-file-name in-file)
		      " " (org-babel-process-file-name out-file))))
    (unless (file-exists-p org-ditaa-jar-path)
      (error "Could not find ditaa.jar at %s" org-ditaa-jar-path))
    (with-temp-file in-file (insert body))
    (message cmd) (shell-command cmd)
    nil)) ;; signal that output has already been written to file

(defun org-babel-prep-session:ditaa (session params)
  "Return an error because ditaa does not support sessions."
  (error "Ditaa does not support sessions"))

(provide 'ob-ditaa)
