This is the user manual for ECB version 2.33beta1.

ECB stands for "Emacs Code Browser". While (X)Emacs already has good
*editing* support for many modes, its *browsing* support is somewhat lacking.
That's where ECB comes in: it displays a number of informational windows that
allow for easy source code navigation and overview.

The informational windows can contain:

   * A directory tree,

   * a list of source files in the current directory,

   * a list of functions/classes/methods/... in the current file, (ECB uses
     the Semantic Bovinator, or Imenu, or etags, for getting this list so all
     languages supported by any of these tools are automatically supported by
     ECB too)

   * a history of recently visited files,

   * the Speedbar and

   * output from compilation (the "*compilation*" window) and other modes
     like help, grep etc. or whatever a user defines to be displayed in this
     window.

As an added bonus, ECB makes sure to keep these informational windows
visible, even when you use `C-x 1' and similar commands.

It goes without saying that you can configure the layout, ie which
informational windows should be displayed where. ECB comes with a number of
ready-made window layouts to choose from.

*Please note*: Experienced ECB users find a complete alphabetical list of all
commands and user-options in *Note Interactive ECB commands:: and *Note
Customizable options::.

1.1 Installation of ECB
=======================

This section describes how to install ECB.

* Menu:

* XEmacs Installation::         Installation of ECB for XEmacs users
* GNU Emacs Installation::      Installation of ECB for GNU Emacs users


File: ecb.info,  Node: XEmacs Installation,  Next: GNU Emacs Installation,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Installation

1.1.1 Installation of ECB for XEmacs users
------------------------------------------

Basic requirement: ECB requires a XEmacs-version >= 21!

For XEmacs-users it is strongly recommended to use the
package-management-system of XEmacs for first-time downloading/installing ECB
or for upgrading to a newer version of ECB.  Here is a short guide (for
details about the package-manager of XEmacs see the related info-manual):

*Caution*: If ECB is already installed and you just want upgrading to a newer
version then it is recommended to deactivate ECB before proceeding with the
steps below!

  1. Choose a download-site

     This can be done via the menu "Tools -> Packages -> Add Download Site":
     Choose one of the listed sites. Or you can customize the option
     `package-get-remote' by hand and save it for future sessions.

  2. Activate the packages list

     This can be done either by the menu "Tools -> Packages -> List and
     Install" or via the command `pui-list-packages'. After that a special
     packages-buffer is displayed where you can interactively install or
     upgrade packages. At the end of this buffer there is a short description
     how to use this buffer.

  3. Install ECB and all required packages

     Mark the package named "ecb" for install. Do this also for the required
     packages "semantic", "eieio" and "speedbar". The package "mail-lib" is
     needed for easy submitting of problem-reports to the ECB-maintainers and
     the package "c-support" is needed for easy using hideshow within the
     Methods-buffer of ECB(1).

     After marking all needed packages for installation hit `x' to install
     them.

     If you have already installed ECB and you want just upgrading to the
     latest available version then proceed as described above - same if you
     want to upgrade one of the required packages.

  4. Start ECB

     Now you can immediately start ECB via the command `ecb-activate'; there
     is no need to restart XEmacs! As an alternative you can first read the
     online-help via `ecb-show-help'.


If you do not like the package-manager of XEmacs but you want installing ECB
"by hand" direct from the ECB-website then you have to follow the
instructions for GNU Emacs, see *Note GNU Emacs Installation::.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) All required packages can simply autom. marked by hitting `r' in the
packages buffer. But this installs a lot of packages more (e.g. the
Newsreader Gnus) which are really not essential for ECB. Therefore it is
recommended to mark the required packages by hand.


File: ecb.info,  Node: GNU Emacs Installation,  Prev: XEmacs Installation,  Up: Installation

1.1.2 Installation of ECB for GNU Emacs users
---------------------------------------------

Basic requirement: ECB requires an Emacs-version >= 21!

*IMPORTANT*: If you are a XEmacs-user please read *Note XEmacs Installation::
before proceeding with the following instructions!

*Using the new cedet 1.0 suite*: From beginning with version 2.01 ECB
supports the next generation of the cedet-tools. But before the cedet 1.0
suite becomes stable this means that ECB runs correctly with loaded cedet 1.0
but the ECB-upgrading feature (*note Downloading new versions::) does not
support autom. upgrading to latest available cedet versions. This will be
first available after first stable release of the new cedet-library 1.0.

So, if the cedet 1.0 suite is loaded then the min- and max-version of
semantic, eieio and speedbar (mentioned in the Requirements-section of the
file `README') have no relevance! If the new cedet 1.0 suite should be used
then just install and load cedet 1.0 like described in the
cedet-installation-instructions and go one with step 3. But ensure you have
loaded - as described in the cedet-`INSTALL'-file - the file
`/path/to/cedet/common/cedet.el' because otherwise cedet is not properly
installed and ECB can not savely recognize that the new cedet-suite is loaded
and should be used.

  1. Download and unpack the ECB archive (probably you have already done this
     :-)

  2. Read the file `README' in the ECB-directory and install the required
     semantic-, eieio- and speedbar-version(1).

     *Please note*: ECB maybe requires a newer version of these libraries
     than shipped with (X)Emacs. You have to install exactly a version ECB
     requires and also to make sure that the correct version is loaded into
     (X)Emacs!

     But ECB performs two autom checks:

        - At load-time: It checks if the packages semantic, eieio and
          speedbar are at least installed so ECB can be loaded. If not it
          offers to download and install them.

        - At start-time: It checks if the correct versions of semantic, eieio
          and speedbar are installed and gives you proper feedback. *Note
          Download required packages::.

     So if you are not sure if you have installed the required packages at
     all or if you have installed the correct versions of these packages then
     do not worry about this, just go on with the following installation
     steps: If ECB is missing something it will give you proper feedback and
     support not later than at load-time or start-time!

  3. Add the new ECB-directory to your `load-path' variable.

     You *MUST* add the ECB-install-directory to the `load-path' either by
     changing the `load-path' variable directly in your `.emacs' or
     `site-lisp/site-start.el' or by working with a file `subdirs.el'(2).

     So for example the needed entry for your `.emacs'-file could be:

        (add-to-list 'load-path
                     "/path/to/your/ecb/installation/directory")

     *ATTENTION*: ECB is NOT properly installed if it's directory is not
     added to `load-path' and for example just loaded by

        (load-file "/path/to/ecb/ecb.el")

     Do not do this!

  4. Load ECB by adding code to your `.emacs':

     If you want to load the complete ECB at (X)Emacs-loadtime (Advantage:
     All ECB-options available after loading ECB. Disadvantage: Increasing
     loadtime(3)):

        (require 'ecb)

     If you want to load the ECB first after starting it by `ecb-activate'
     (Advantage: Fast loading(4).  Disadvantage: ECB- and semantic-options
     first available after starting ECB):

        (require 'ecb-autoloads)

     This loads all available autoloads of ECB, e.g. `ecb-activate',
     `ecb-minor-mode', `ecb-byte-compile' and `ecb-show-help'.

     Regardless which method you prefer: In both cases the used statement
     must be placed *after* the statement of step 3!

  5. Restart (X)Emacs.

ECB is now ready for use and can be activated by calling `M-x ecb-activate'
or `ecb-minor-mode'. Now you can either starting using ECB or you can do
these optional installation steps:

  6. Reading the online help with `ecb-show-help'

     Maybe you are interested to read the online-help of ECB before first
     start.

  7. Bytecompiling ECB with `ecb-byte-compile'

     This byte compiles ECB. You can safely ignore all messages if there are
     any. (You can also bytecompile ECB from the command-line either by using
     the `Makefile' or by using the batch-file `make.bat'; just read the
     comments in that file you choose.)

  8. Installing the Info-help of ECB

     The ECB distribution contains a subdirectory `info-help' which contains
     the online-help of ECB in Info-format. You can install this online help
     so it's available in the Top-directory of Info. There are two ways to do
     this:

        - Use "install-info" (recommended):

            1. Copy the files of the subdirectory `info-help' into the
               info-directory of Emacs

            2. Install the file `info-help/ecb.info' with the command
               "install-info" (if available on your system) in the `dir'-file.

          The supplied `Makefile' offers a target `install-help' which does
          both of these steps. You have just to call `make install-help' with
          the correct EMACSINFOPATH set (see the comment in `Makefile'). Here
          is an example:

             make EMACSINFOPATH=/path/to/emacs/info install-help

        - Manual Installation:

          Copy the files of the subdirectory `info-help' into the
          info-directory of Emacs and modify the file `dir' manually.

     But it doesn't matter if you do not execute this step (8.) because the
     online help of ECB is always available though, see `ecb-show-help'
     (*note Interactive ECB commands::).


---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) The speedbar-version shipped with GNU Emacs <= 21.3 does not satisfy the
requirements for this feature - download a newer one!

(2) This works at least for Emacs but XEmacs may have slightly different
mechanisms; see the XEmacs documentation

(3) Cause of full loading of ECB itself and also the packages semantic, eieio
and speedbar regardless if ECB is started.

(4) ECB, semantic, eieio and speedbar are first loaded after starting ECB or
with other words: ECB and semantic are not loaded if you do not use/need them

1.2.1 General hints for a correct setup
---------------------------------------

ECB is for browsing files and therefore you have to setup your
Emacs-configuration properly so the file-parsing engines like semantic, imenu
or etags can be activated automatically for parsing your Emacs-Lisp, C, C++
or Java buffers(1). For this Emacs must activate the correct `major-mode' for
the source-files and Emacs can only do this if the option `auto-mode-alist'
is setup correctly. The correct major-modes and possible file-extensions(2)
are:

LANGUAGE         MAJOR-MODE                              EXTENSION(S)
Emacs Lisp       `emacs-lisp-mode'                       .el
C                `c-mode'                                .h, .c
C++              `c++-mode'                              .h, .hxx, .hh, .HH,
                                                         .cxx, .cpp, .cc, .CC
Java             `java-mode' or `jde-mode' (if you use   .java
                 JDEE)                                   

Example: If you want files with extension ".cpp" being c++-parsed by semantic
and ECB, your `auto-mode-alist' must contain an entry like:

   ("\\.cpp\\'" . c++-mode)

After this ECB will correctly parse your ".cpp"-sources and display all the
parsing information in the ECB-methods buffer.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) semantic supports some more "languages" like Makefiles etc. but these are
the most important ones.

(2) Especially for C++ and C you can use any extension you want but these are
the most common ones!

1.2.2 Setting up semantic
-------------------------

To ensure ECB and semantic are working correctly for all by semantic
supported languages you have to pay attention to the following aspects
concerning your Emacs-setup:

  1. Setting up semantic itself

     For all semantic-supported file-types parsing files is done completely
     by semantic. ECB just displays the parsing results. For all needs of ECB
     semantic is completely setup by ECB itself, i.e. ECB sets up semantic
     for you! You have only to add the installation directory of semantic to
     your `load-path' (in an appropriate way)!

     *Please note*: If you setup semantic for yourself following the
     recommendations in the installation instructions of semantic then you
     have probably added code to your startup-file like:

        (setq semantic-load-turn-everything-on t)
        (require 'semantic-load)

     Be aware that this also enables the minor-modes
     `semantic-show-dirty-mode' and `semantic-show-unmatched-syntax-mode'
     where the former one highlights all code which has to be reparsed with
     dark background (which results in large portions of dark background ;-)
     and the latter one underlines all syntax which can not be parsed.
     Especially the former one can be really annoying.

     To switch off these modes you can add to your startup-file:

        (global-semantic-show-dirty-mode -1)
        (global-semantic-show-unmatched-syntax-mode -1)

  2. Checking your hooks

     If you have already checked point (1.) and if you have still problems
     getting ECB/semantic working properly for your sources you should check
     the related major-mode hook. Every major-mode X has a hook with name
     "X-hook" which is evaluated after activating the major-mode (see above,
     2.), e.g. the hook for the major-mode `c++-mode' is `c++-mode-hook'.

     Semantic adds automatically during load-time a special "semantic-setup"
     to these major-mode hooks(1) in form of a "setup-function". Example: For
     c and c++ modes semantic adds `semantic-default-c-setup' to
     `c-mode-hook' and `c++-mode-hook'.

     If your own Emacs-setup (e.g. in `.emacs' or `site-lisp/site-start.el')
     overwrites such a major-mode-hook then semantic can not be activated for
     this major-mode and in consequence ECB can not work properly too!

     Check if your Emacs-setup uses somewhere `setq' for adding code to a
     major-mode-hook. *IMPORTANT*: Use `add-hook' instead of `setq'(2)!


If your source-files are "running" with correct `major-mode' and correct
major-mode hooks ECB and semantic will do what you expect them doing!

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) Of course only for major-modes supported by semantic!

(2) `setq' replaces/overwrites the current value of a hook with the new value
whereas `add-hook' *adds* the new value to the old-value of the hook!


File: ecb.info,  Node: Non-semantic files,  Prev: Setting up semantic,  Up: Setting up Emacs

1.2.3 Setup for file types not supported by semantic
----------------------------------------------------

From version 1.94 on ECB supports also parsing and displaying file-contents
for file-types not supported by semantic (i.e. there is no semantic-grammar
available for such file-types).

Such non-semantic file-types can often be parsed by imenu and/or etags. Both
of these parsing methods are now supported: ECB can display the results of
imenu and/or etags in its Method-buffer. ECB uses for this speedbar-logic.
Therefore the following speedbar options takes effect for this feature:

   - `speedbar-dynamic-tags-function-list'

   - `speedbar-tag-split-minimum-length'

   - `speedbar-tag-regroup-maximum-length'

   - `speedbar-tag-hierarchy-method'

Normally there should be no need for you to bother with these options,
because the default values are suitable for most situations! But if you are
not satisfied with the parsing/display results then you can change some of
these options.

1.3 First steps after activating ECB first time
===============================================

This section of the ECB online-help is displayed automatically by ECB after
activating ECB first time and describes what are the first basic steps:

  1. Configure where ECB can find your sources:

     Call `M-x customize-option RET ecb-source-path RET'(1). This lets you
     customize the option `ecb-source-path' with the customize-feature of
     Emacs. This opens a customize-buffer where you can insert all the
     directories where ECB can find your source-files. Save your changes with
     the button "Save for future sessions" and then throw away this
     customize-buffer either by killing it with `M-x kill-buffer' or clicking
     at the button "Finish".

  2. Take a look at the most important options of ECB Call `M-x
     ecb-customize-most-important RET' and see a list of options which you
     should at least know that these options exist.

  3. Read the online-help of ECB:

     The online-help of ECB is available via

        - calling `M-x ecb-show-help',

        - pressing `C-c . h' or

        - using the menu "ECB".

     (The section you are currently reading is part of the online-help of ECB)

     The chapter "Tips and tricks" is also very interesting!

  4. Start working with ECB.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) This means first hitting the keys `M' (Meta- or Alt-key) and `x'
simultaneously, inserting "customize-option" in the minibuffer, hitting
RETURN, inserting "ecb-source-path" in the minibuffer and finally hitting
RETURN again

2 Overview
**********

ECB is a global minor-mode which offers a couple of "ECB-windows" for
browsing your sources comfortable with the mouse and the keyboard.  These
"special" windows are also called "interactors" in this manual.

ECB offers some basic interactors to browse your sources:
   - ECB-Directories for browsing directories

   - ECB-Sources for browsing source-files and a file-history

   - ECB-Methods for browsing the contents of a source

See *Note Basic interactors:: for a detailled description what these basic
interactors offer. See *Note ECB-interactors:: for a general introduction in
the interactor-concept of ECB.

In addition to these "special" ECB-windows you have always an "edit-area"
where you can edit your source-files. The edit-area can be divided into
several "edit-windows" - as many as you need (*note The edit-area::). And at
the bottom of the ECB-frame a persistent "compilation-window" (also called
"compile-window") can be displayed (optional), where all the output of
Emacs-compilation (compile, grep etc.) is shown (*note Temp- and
compile-buffers::).

The following "screenshot" illustrates the typical layout of the ECB-frame(1):

4 All interactors of ECB
************************

ECB displays a number of informational windows that allow for easy source
code navigation and overview. These informational windows are called
"interactors". Each interactor is displayed in its own special window/buffer
which is dedicated and read-only.

There are some "basic" interactors (e.g. for browsing directories and
sources) and some "add-on" interactors for special purposes like displaying
the definition of the current symbol under point. This chapter describes all
interactors of ECB in detail.

4.1 The basic interactors of ECB
================================

ECB offers basic interactors for browsing directory-structures, files of a
directory and contents of source-files (e.g. methods and variables). These
basic interactors are build from a special class of interactors, called
"tree-buffer". See *Note Tree-buffer basics:: for more details about the
functionality of tree-buffers. See *Note Tree-buffer styles:: to get an
impression about the look&feel of these tree-buffers.

In the following subsections these basic interactors of ECB will be explained
in detail.

* Tree-buffer basics::          General introduction into tree-buffers
* Tree-buffer styles::          Displaying the trees with different styles

File: ecb.info,  Node: Tree-buffer basics,  Next: Tree-buffer styles,  Prev: Basic interactors,  Up: Basic interactors

4.1.1 General introduction into tree-buffers
--------------------------------------------

ECB displays most of its informations (e.g. about directory-structures or
file-contents) in so called "tree-buffers" which means the display of such a
tree-buffer is structured in a tree consisting of "tree-nodes". Every line in
a tree-buffer displays exactly one tree-node. Each node can have any
arbitrary number of "children"-nodes. If a tree-node has no children then it
is called a "leaf".

Each tree-buffer of ECB is displayed in an own special ECB-window/buffer
which is read-only ie. not editable.

The difference between a natural tree like a fir and an ECB-tree is that the
root(-node) of a tree-buffer is not visible but only its children. In the
example below the nodes parent-node-1 and parent-node-2 are the children of
the invisible root-node.

If a tree-node contains at least one child it is displayed with a special
expand/collapse-symbol (see the example below). This symbol allows expanding
(rsp. collapsing) the tree-node wheras expanding means to display the
children-nodes and collapsing means to hide the childrens of a tree-node.

Here is an example of a tree-buffer:

   [+] parent-node-1  -------.
   [-] parent-node-2  -------|
       [-] expanded  --------|
           leaf-node-1  -----|
           leaf-node-2  -----|-----[tree-nodes]
           leaf-node-3  -----|
           leaf-node-4  -----|
       [+] collapsed  -------´
        |
        `-----------------[expand/collapse-symbol]

In most cases an action is triggered when clicking with the mouse onto a
tree-node(1) (e.g. clicking onto "leaf-node-1" or "parent-node-1" in the
example above). Which actions depends on the type of the tree-buffer. For
example clicking on a tree-node in the ECB-sources-buffer (which is the name
of a source-file) opens the relelated file in the edit-area of ECB (*note ECB
Sources-buffer::) whereas clicking onto a node in the ECB-methods-buffer
(which is the name of a tag in the current source-file displayed in the
edit-area) "jumps" to the location of this tag in the source-buffer in the
edit-area (*note ECB Methods-buffer::).

Almost every interactor of ECB offers a special popup-menu when clicking with
the right mouse-button (of course also possible via keyboard, see *Note Using
the keyboard::) onto a tree-node (e.g. some senseful actions possible for
directory-nodes like grepping this directory or performing version-control
actions for this directory or something else).

See *Note ECB Directories-buffer::, *Note ECB Sources-buffer::, *Note ECB
Methods-buffer:: and *Note Add-on interactors:: for a detailed description
which actions are triggered and which popup-menus are offered in all the
interactors of ECB.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) Of course using the keyboard is also possible, see *Note Using the
keyboard::.

4.1.2 Displaying the trees with different styles
------------------------------------------------

ECB offers three different styles for the tree-buffers in the ECB-windows.
Two of the styles are ascii-based and one style uses images for drawing the
tree-structure.

* Images for Methods-buffer::   Images for the tags in the Methods-buffer


File: ecb.info,  Node: Style basics,  Next: Ascii-based styles,  Prev: Tree-buffer styles,  Up: Tree-buffer styles

4.1.2.1 Basic knowledge about the styles
........................................

There are nine image-names which define the control- and guide-symbols to
draw the tree. Here is the list of the allowed image-names and the related
corresponding ascii-symbols:

   - open ("[-]"): The control-symbol displayed for an opened tree-node which
     has several subnodes. Clicking onto this control closes the node.

   - close ("[+]"): The control-symbol displayed for a closed tree-node, i.e.
     an expandable node with subnodes but all subnodes are hidden. Clicking
     onto this control opened the node and displays its subnodes - if there
     are any. If it has no subnodes the empty-symbol will be displayed.

   - empty ("[x]"): The symbol displayed for an empty node. An empty node is a
     node which could have subnodes but has currently none.

   - leaf ("*"): The symbol displayed for a node which can not have any
     subnodes so it is a "leaf" in the tree.

   - guide (" |"): The symbol used for drawing vertical "guide-lines" for
     opened nodes.  See the example below.

   - no-guide ("  "): Sometimes invisible guide-lines are needed to draw the
     tree.

   - end-guide (" `"): The symbol used for the guide-line of the last subnode
     of an opened node.

   - handle ("-"): The symbol displayed before every subnode. Each handle is
     connected to a guide-line - either a normal guide or an end-guide.

   - no-handle (" "): An invisible handle.

A tree will be build-up with these elements like follows:

   [-] node-with-subnodes      (open)
    |-[+] not-empty-subnode1   (guide+handle+close)
    |-[x] empty-subnode        (guide+handle+empty)
    `-[-] not-empty-subnode2   (end-guide+handle+open)
       |-* leaf-1              (no-guide+no-handle+guide+handle+leaf)
       `-* leaf-2              (no-guide+no-handle+end-guide+handle+leaf)


File: ecb.info,  Node: Ascii-based styles,  Next: Tree-buffers with images,  Prev: Style basics,  Up: Tree-buffer styles

4.1.2.2 How to customize the ascii-styles
.........................................

The ECB-option `ecb-tree-buffer-style' offers two different styles completely
drawn with ascii-controls and -guides.

Ascii-style with guide-lines (value `ascii-guides')(1):

   [-] ECB
    |  [+] code-save
    `- [-] ecb-images
        |  [-] directories
        |   |  [-] height-15
        |   |   |  * close.xpm
        |   |   |  * empty.xpm
        |   |   |  * leaf.xpm
        |   |   `- * open.xpm
        |   |  [+] height-17
        |   |  [+] height-19
        |   `- [+] height-21
        |  [x] history
        |  [x] methods
        `- [x] sources

Ascii-style without guide-lines (value `ascii-no-guides') - this is the style
used by ECB <= 1.96:

   [-] ECB
       [+] code-save
       [-] ecb-images
           [-] directories
               [-] height-15
                   * close.xpm
                   * empty.xpm
                   * leaf.xpm
                   * open.xpm
               [+] height-17
               [+] height-19
               [+] height-21
           [x] history
           [x] methods
           [x] sources

The tree-layout of both ascii-styles can be affected with the options
`ecb-tree-indent' and `ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before' (the examples above
have set 4 for the former and true for the latter one).  For the guide-style
the face and color of the guide- and handle-symbols can be customized with
the option `ecb-tree-guide-line-face' (default is the equal-named face).

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) For a better look&feel of such a tree-buffer ECB displays only the last
subnode of an opened node with a handle!


File: ecb.info,  Node: Tree-buffers with images,  Next: Images for Methods-buffer,  Prev: Ascii-based styles,  Up: Tree-buffer styles

4.1.2.3 Which images are used for the tree
..........................................

Depending on the value of `ecb-tree-buffer-style' and the image-support of
(X)Emacs, the tree-buffer try to use images instead of strings to draw a
nice-looking tree.

If images can and should be used then the option
`ecb-tree-image-icons-directories' tells ECB where to search for suitable
image-icons for each of the nine image-names (see above). An image is used
for displaying a control with name "XXX" if one of the directories of
`ecb-tree-image-icons-directories' contains an image-file with basename
"ecb-XXX" and an extension which is supported by (X)Emacs. Currently
supported extensions are ".xpm", ".png", ".gif", ".jpeg", ."jpg" and ".xbm".

Example: To display the control with name "open" with a suitable image then
one of the directories of `ecb-tree-image-icons-directories' must contain a
file with name "ecb-open.xpm" or "ecb-open.png" etc. See the description of
this option to get all important details how and in which sequence ECB
searches the directories of `ecb-tree-image-icons-directories'.

ECB comes with predefined default-images usable for every tree-buffer and
special images for the Directories- and the Methods-tree-buffer.  They are
defined in several different heights - so for the most senseful font-heights
of a tree-buffer a fitting image-size should be available. The shipped images
reside either in the subdirectory "ecb-images" of the ECB-installation or -
if ECB is installed as regular XEmacs-package - in the ECB-etc data-directory
(the directory returned by evaluating (locate-data-directory "ecb"). If you
do not want to change the images then you normally have nothing to do because
the default value of `ecb-tree-image-icons-directories' points already to the
correct image-directories.

A special remark for XEmacs:

At least XEmacs 21.14 (but probably previous versions too) has a bug in its
display-engine which prevents adjacent images to be displayed correctly. The
effect is, that in a row of two or more adjacent images (e.g.
end-guide+handle+open - see the tree-example above) always all images are
masked by the last one, means only the last one is visible.  If at least one
normal character (e.g. a space) is placed between two images then the images
are displayed correctly. Therefore ECB has implemented the following
work-around to get best possible results with XEmacs: open-, close-, empty-,
leaf-, guide-, end-guide- and no-guide-images are displayed with images and
the handle- and the no-handle-images are displayed with the corresponding
ascii-symbols (which is "-" rsp. " "). The face (the color) of the
handle-symbol is customizable via the option `ecb-tree-guide-line-face'.

This bug is already reported to the XEmacs-team. If your XEmacs has fixed
this bug then add the following to your `.emacs'-file (or whereever your
emacs-setup is located):

   (setq tree-buffer-enable-xemacs-image-bug-hack nil)

Then ECB uses images without any special work-around with XEmacs too.  Just
try it - if the tree-buffers look ugly then the XEmacs-bug is probably not
fixed correctly.


File: ecb.info,  Node: Images for Methods-buffer,  Prev: Tree-buffers with images,  Up: Tree-buffer styles

4.1.2.4 Special images for the Methods-buffer
.............................................

ECB can display all the semantic-tags in the Method-buffer with special icons
for methods, variables and classes - each of them with a different icon
dependend of the protection of the tag. This feature can be disabled/enabled
via the option `ecb-display-image-icons-for-semantic-tags'. All the special
images are located in that directory where the option
`ecb-tree-image-icons-directories' point to for methods.

4.1.3 ECB Directories-interactor
--------------------------------

The ECB directories interactor is for browsing directories. The direct
children of the invisible root-node are called "source-path" and can be
defined with the option `ecb-source-path'. Each source-path is the
starting-node of the complete directory-structure below this path and can be
browsed with the directories-interactor.

When a sources interactor is contained in the current layout then per default
only directories and subdirectories are displayed in the directories
tree-buffer (the source-files are displayed in the sources tree-buffer - see
*Note ECB Sources-buffer::) but this can be changed with the option
`ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer'.

4.1.3.1 Usage of the directories interactor
...........................................

   * Select directories (and - if enabled - source files) in the
     "ECB-Directories" buffer by clicking a mouse button on the directory
     name or by hitting RETURN when the cursor is placed on the item line,
     see *Note Usage of ECB::.

     IMPORTANT: If you use the POWER-click (i.e. hold down the SHIFT-key
     while clicking with the primary mouse button (*note Using the mouse::)
     or RETURN (*note Using the keyboard::)) on a directory node in the this
     buffer then the directory-contents-cache for this directory will be
     refreshed and actualized.

   * Directory names with a "[+]" symbol after (or before) them can be
     expanded/collapsed by clicking on the symbol, pressing the TAB key
     (*note Using the keyboard::) when the cursor is placed on the package
     line or clicking a mouse button on the item, see *Note Using the mouse::.

   * Right clicking on an item will open a popup menu where different
     operations on the item under the mouse cursor can be performed. This
     popup-menu offers operations for version-control, dired, grep, some
     file-operations like creating a directory and commands to make a
     directory a source-path in the sense of `ecb-source-path'.

   * Pressing F2 will open the ECB customization group (*note Customizing::)
     in the edit window. F3 shows the online help in the edit-window.
     Pressing F4 in the ECB-directories buffer will offer adding a new
     source-path.

When source-files-nodes are displayed in the directories-buffer (see
`ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer') then for these nodes all
descriptions of section *Note ECB Sources-buffer:: are valid.

4.1.3.2 Activating/Displaying the directories interactor
........................................................

Either use one of the predefined layouts which contain the directories
interactor (*note Changing the ECB-layout::) (e.g. via `C-c . l c') or create
a new ecb-layout via the command `ecb-create-new-layout' and add a buffer of
type "directories" into this new layout (*note Creating a new ECB-layout::).

4.1.3.3 Customizing the directories interactor
..............................................

See *Note ecb-directories:: for a list of all options currently available for
customizing this interactors to your needs.

4.1.4 ECB Sources- and history-interactor
-----------------------------------------

ECB offers two interactors for displaying source-file-names: The sources- and
the history-interactor. The former one displays all source-file names of the
currently selected directory of the directories-interactor (*note ECB
Directories-buffer::) whereas the latter one displays the names of all
currently loaded source-files regardless in which directory they reside so it
works as a "history" of source-files.

Both the sources- and the history-tree-buffer are "flat" tree-buffers means
all nodes are direct children of the invisible root-node and can not be
expanded.

4.1.4.1 Usage of the sources/history interactor
...............................................

   * Source files can be selected by clicking with the primary mouse button
     (*note Using the mouse::) or hitting RETURN (*note Using the keyboard::)
     on the source row in the "ECB-Sources" or "ECB-History" windows. The
     buffer of the selected source-file will be displayed in an edit-window -
     which one depends on the setting in `ecb-mouse-click-destination'.

     IMPORTANT: If you use the POWER-click (i.e. hold down the SHIFT-key
     while clicking with the primary mouse button (*note Using the mouse::)
     or RETURN (*note Using the keyboard::)) on a source row in the
     ECB-Sources or ECB-History windows then the source will not be displayed
     in an edit-window but it will be scanned in the background and all its
     contents (e.g. methods and variables) are listed in the "ECB Methods"
     window (*note ECB Methods-buffer::. So you can get an overlook over the
     source without changing the buffer in the edit-window.

   * Clicking on the source file with the secondary mouse button or C-RETURN
     (*note Usage of ECB::) will open the source file in another edit window
     - which one depends on the setting in `ecb-mouse-click-destination'.

   * Right clicking on a source file (mouse-button 3) will open a popup menu
     where different operation on the item under the mouse cursor can be
     performed. This popup-menu offers operations for version-control, dired,
     grep, filtering the file-names and some file-operations like deleting
     the related file from disk.


4.1.4.2 Activating/Displaying the sources/history interactor
............................................................

Either use one of the predefined layouts which contain the sources (rsp.
history) interactor (*note Changing the ECB-layout::) (e.g. via `C-c . l c')
or create a new ecb-layout via the command `ecb-create-new-layout' and add a
buffer of type "sources" (rsp. "history") into this new layout (*note
Creating a new ECB-layout::).

4.1.4.3 Customizing the sources/history interactor
..................................................

See *Note ecb-sources:: and *Note ecb-history:: for a list of all options
currently available for customizing these interactors to your needs.


File: ecb.info,  Node: ECB Methods-buffer,  Prev: ECB Sources-buffer,  Up: Basic interactors

4.1.5 The ECB Methods interactor
--------------------------------

The "ECB-Methods" interactor contains all parsed and recognized tags of the
current source-buffer. It is called "Method-buffer" because ECB is mostly
designed for browsing sourcecode files and for programming-languages these
tags are often methods (and variables etc.) To simplify explanations we talk
in the following only about methods and variables - but in general the
method-buffer can contain any kind of tags (e.g. sections and subsections for
texinfo buffers).

Per default the content of the methods-interactor is automatically
synchronized and updated with current point of the current source-buffer in
the edit-area (see `ecb-window-sync' and *Note ECB-window synchronizing::).

4.1.5.1 Usage of the methods interactor
.......................................

   * When a method/variable is selected with the primary mouse button (*note
     Using the mouse::) or RETURN (*note Using the keyboard::) the buffer in
     the edit-window (which one depends on the setting in
     `ecb-mouse-click-destination') will jump to the method/variable.

     IMPORTANT: If you use the POWER-click (i.e. hold down the SHIFT-key
     while clicking with the primary mouse button (*note Using the mouse::)
     or RETURN (*note Using the keyboard::)) on a node in this buffer then
     the edit-buffer will be narrowed to the selected tag (see also option
     `ecb-tag-visit-post-actions'). But this works only for sources parsed by
     semantic, not by imenu or etags!

   * Clicking on a method/variable with the secondary mouse button or C-RETURN
     (*note Usage of ECB::) will jump to the method in another edit window -
     which one depends on the setting in `ecb-mouse-click-destination'.

   * Right clicking on a method/variable will open a popup menu where
     different operation on the item under the mouse cursor can be performed.
     The popup-menu offers commands for filtering the displayed tree-nodes,
     hiding/narrowing the related tags in the source-buffer and
     expanding/collapsing one/all tree-nodes according to a certain
     expansion-level.


4.1.5.2 Activating/Displaying the methods interactor
....................................................

Either use one of the predefined layouts which contain the methods interactor
(*note Changing the ECB-layout::) (e.g. via `C-c . l c') or create a new
ecb-layout via the command `ecb-create-new-layout' and add a buffer of type
"methods" into this new layout (*note Creating a new ECB-layout::).

4.1.5.3 Customizing the methods interactor
..........................................

See *Note ecb-methods:: for a list of all options currently available for
customizing this interactor to your needs.

4.2 Add-on interactors of ECB
=============================

This chapter gives detailled informations about available add-on interactors.
This includes basic desciptions what they do as well as how to use them.

* Menu:

* Semantic analyser::           Analyses and displays semantic context
* Symboldefinition::            Displays definition of current symbol


File: ecb.info,  Node: Semantic analyser,  Next: Symboldefinition,  Prev: Add-on interactors,  Up: Add-on interactors

4.2.1 Displaying the current semantic context
---------------------------------------------

The cedet-suite contains the "semantic analyzer" which is a library tool that
performs context analysis and can derive useful information. See the related
node in the info-manual of cedet/semantic for more detailed informations
about this tool.

The analyzer output can be used through a special ECB-interactor. This
interface lists details about the analysis, such as the current function,
local arguments and variables, details on the prefix (the symbol the cursor
is on), and a list of all possible completions (see
`semantic-analyze-possible-completions' for more details about completions
available via the semantic-analyser).

Per default the content of the analyser-interactor is automatically
synchronized and updated with current point of the current source-buffer in
the edit-area (see `ecb-window-sync' and *Note ECB-window synchronizing::).

The analyser-interactor is of type tree-buffer. See *Note Tree-buffer
basics:: for basic informations how to use such a tree-buffer.

4.2.1.1 Usage of the analyser-interactor
........................................

   * When a node-name in the "Context"-bucket is selected with the primary
     mouse button (*note Using the mouse::) or RETURN (*note Using the
     keyboard::) the buffer in the edit-window (which one depends on the
     setting in `ecb-mouse-click-destination') will jump to the related
     entry. For strongly typed languages, this means you will jump to the
     definition of the variable, slot, or type definition.

   * Clicking on a node-name in the "Context"-bucket with the secondary mouse
     button or C-RETURN (*note Usage of ECB::) will jump to the related entry
     in another edit window - which one depends on the setting in
     `ecb-mouse-click-destination'.

   * If you click on a node-name in the "Completions"-bucket, then the text
     that was recently analyzed will be replaced with the name of the tag
     that was clicked on in the analyser-interactor.

   * Right clicking with the mouse (or with the keyboard, see *Note Using
     popup-menus::) onto a tree-node opens a popup-menu which allows to
     display additional (if available) informations to the current node.

4.2.1.2 Interactive commands of the analyser-interactor
.......................................................

     ECB offers the following commands for the analyser-interactor:

        - `ecb-analyse-buffer-sync'

        - `ecb-goto-window-analyse'

        - `ecb-maximize-window-analyse'

     See *Note Interactive ECB commands:: for details about these commands.
But you should not have any need to call `ecb-analyse-buffer-sync' directly
because ECB automatically syncronizes the analyser-interactor with current
active edit-buffer.


4.2.1.3 Activating/Displaying the analyser-interactor
.....................................................

Either use one of the predefined layouts "left-analyse" or
"leftright-analyse" (e.g. via `C-c . l c') or create a new ecb-layout via the
command `ecb-create-new-layout' and add a buffer of type "other" and name
"analyse" into this new layout (*note Creating a new ECB-layout::).

4.2.1.4 Customizing the analyser interactor

customizing this interactor to your needs.

5 Activation and Deactivation
*****************************

This chapter describes all aspects of activating and deactivating ECB.

* Menu:

* Standard activation::         How to manually (de)activate ECB
* Automatic activation::        Automatically (de)activating ECB

*IMPORTANT*: Regardless of the activation-type (standard or automatic) the
activation-process of ECB is always completely failure-save. This means any
error during any step of the activation-process forces a complete cleanup
(e.g. removing hooks, disabling advices etc.) of all settings ECB did (e.g.
adding hooks, activating advices etc.) until the failure. Therefore if
ECB-activation stops cause of a failure then you can be sure that your Emacs
has the same state as before the ECB-activation-start!


File: ecb.info,  Node: Standard activation,  Next: Automatic activation,  Prev: Activation and Deactivation,  Up: Activation and Deactivation

5.1 Standard activation and deactivation
========================================

Call `M-x ecb-activate' and `M-x ecb-deactivate' to activate or deactivate
ECB(1). If you want ECB started in a new frame see the option
`ecb-new-ecb-frame' (default is nil).  `ecb-activate' always raises and
selects the ECB-frame even if ECB is already started.

Because ECB is a global minor-mode it can also be (de)activated/toggled by
`M-x ecb-minor-mode'.

The following sequence of hooks is evaluated during activation of ECB:
  1. `ecb-before-activate-hook'

  2. <All actions for activation but no layout drawing>

  3. `ecb-activate-before-layout-draw-hook'

  4. `ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook'

  5. <Drawing the layout>

  6. `ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook'

  7. `ecb-activate-hook'

The following sequence of hooks is evaluated during deactivation of ECB:
  1. `ecb-before-deactivate-hook'

  2. <All actions for deactivation of ECB>

  3. `ecb-deactivate-hook'

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) Activation is also possible via the menu "Tools -> Start Code Browser
(ECB)".


File: ecb.info,  Node: Automatic activation,  Prev: Standard activation,  Up: Activation and Deactivation

5.2 Automatic activation and deactivation
=========================================

There are two ways for auto. (de)activation ECB after Emacs-start and for
different window-configurations.

`ecb-auto-activate'
     This option is for auto. activating ECB after Emacs-startup. Set this to
     not nil and ECB will automatically be started after Emacs comes up.

`window-manager support'
     The window-manager support of ECB deactivates ECB when going to another
     window-configuration and reactivates ECB when coming back to the
     ECB-window-configuration. For all details about this see *Note
     Window-managers and ECB::.

6.1 Working with the mouse in the ECB-windows
=============================================

Normally you get best usage if you use ECB with a mouse. ECB distinguishes
between a "primary" and a "secondary" mouse-button.

With the option `ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons' the following
combinations of primary and secondary mouse-buttons are possible:

   - primary: mouse-2, secondary: C-mouse-2(1). This is the default.

   - primary: mouse-1, secondary: C-mouse-1

   - primary: mouse-1, secondary: mouse-2

If you change this during ECB is activated you must deactivate and activate
ECB again to take effect.

6.1.1 The primary mouse-button
------------------------------

A click with the primary button causes the main effect in each ECB-buffer:

   - ECB Directories: Expanding/collapsing nodes and displaying files in the
     ECB-Sources buffer.

   - ECB sources/history: Opening the file in that edit-window specified by
     the option `ecb-mouse-click-destination'.

   - ECB Methods: Jumping to the method in that edit-window specified by the
     option `ecb-mouse-click-destination'.

6.1.2 The POWER- or SHIFT-click
-------------------------------

A click with the primary mouse-button while the SHIFT-key is pressed is
called the POWER-click and does the following (depending on the ECB-buffer
where the POWER-click occurs):

   - ECB Directory: Refreshing the directory-contents-cache (see
     `ecb-cache-directory-contents').

   - ECB sources/history: Only displaying the source-contents in the
     method-buffer but not displaying the source-file in an edit-window. This
     means it opens the clicked source only in the background and shows all
     its methods/variables in ECB-Methods; the buffer of the edit-window is
     not changed! This is very useful to get only an overlook for a certain
     source.

   - ECB Methods: Narrowing to the clicked method/variable/ect... (see
     `ecb-tag-visit-post-actions'). But this works only for sources parsed by
     semantic, not by imenu or etags!

Per default the complete node-name of an item in a tree-buffer is displayed
in the echo-area if the mouse moves over it, regardless if the related window
is the active one or not. You get the same effect always after a POWER-click.
In general: Via `ecb-show-node-info-in-minibuffer' you can specify in a
detailed manner for every ECB tree-buffer when and which node-info should be
displayed in the minibuffer.

6.1.3 The secondary mouse-button
--------------------------------

The secondary mouse-button is for opening (jumping to) the file in another
edit-window (see the documentation of the option
`ecb-mouse-click-destination').

6.1.4 The right mouse-button
----------------------------

In each ECB-buffer mouse-3 (= right button) opens a special context
popup-menu for the clicked item where you can choose several senseful actions.

With the options `ecb-directories-menu-user-extension',
`ecb-sources-menu-user-extension', `ecb-methods-menu-user-extension' and
`ecb-history-menu-user-extension' you can add statically new commands to the
popup-menus. See the docstring of `ecb-directories-menu-user-extension' for
more details.

With the options `ecb-directories-menu-user-extension-function',
`ecb-sources-menu-user-extension-function',
`ecb-methods-menu-user-extension-function' and
`ecb-history-menu-user-extension-function' you can add new commands to the
popup-menus in a dynamic manner. See the docstring of
`ecb-directories-menu-user-extension-function' for more details.

With the options `ecb-directories-menu-sorter', `ecb-sources-menu-sorter',
`ecb-methods-menu-sorter' and `ecb-history-menu-sorter' you can even
re-arrange all the entries of the popup-menus.

6.1.5 Horizontal scrolling with the mouse
-----------------------------------------

In each tree-buffer of ECB you can easily scroll left and right with the
mouse if the option `ecb-tree-easy-hor-scroll' is not `nil'.

The reason for this is: XEmacs has horizontal scroll-bars so invisible parts
beyond the right window-border of a tree-buffer can always made visible very
easy.

GNU Emacs does not have hor. scroll-bars so especially with the mouse it is
quite impossible to scroll smoothly right and left. The functions
`scroll-left' and `scroll-right' can be annoying and are also not bound to
mouse-buttons.

ECB offers three ways for smoothly hor. scrolling with GNU Emacs if
`ecb-tree-easy-hor-scroll' is a positive integer-value S:

   * In all ECB-tree-buffers the keys `M-mouse-1' and `M-mouse-3' are bound
     to scrolling left rsp. right with scroll-step S.

   * Clicking with mouse-1 or mouse-2 onto the edge of the modeline has the
     same effect, i.e. if you click with mouse-1 onto the left \(resp right)
     edge of the modeline you will scroll left \(resp. right) with
     scroll-step S.

   * Additionally `C-M-mouse-1' and `C-M-mouse-3' are bound to scrolling left
     rsp. right with scroll-step `window-width' - 2.

This is NOT done for XEmacs cause of its horizontal scrollbars. If you want
scrolling left and right with the mouse in XEmacs then activate the
horizontal scrollbars.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) means mouse-2 while CTRL-key is pressed.

6.2 Working with the keyboard in the ECB-windows
================================================

ECB offers the `ecb-mode-map' which binds the most important functions of ECB
to keys so you can easily use ECB in every window(1) without a mouse.

IMPORTANT: Do not modify `ecb-mode-map' directly! The option `ecb-key-map'
defines all ECB keybindings, including a common prefix-key (This is by
default `C-c .'). If there are conflicts with other minor-modes or packages
you can define very easy another prefix. Please read carefully the
description of `ecb-key-map' (*note ecb-general::).!

The following sections describe special topics about using the keyboard in
the ECB-tree-buffers:

* Menu:

* Navigation/Selection::        Keyboard navigation/selection in a tree-buffer
* Incremental search::          Find nodes as fast as possible
* Personal tree-keybindings::   Adding personal keybindings to a tree-buffer
* Using popup-menus::           Using the popup-menus from keyboard.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) Regardless if a tree-window or an edit-window


File: ecb.info,  Node: Navigation/Selection,  Next: Incremental search,  Prev: Using the keyboard,  Up: Using the keyboard

6.2.1 Navigation and Selection in a tree-buffer
-----------------------------------------------

In the ECB-buffers RETURN and TAB are the most important keys:

   * RETURN does the same as the primary button and C-RETURN does the same as
     the secondary button. S-RETURN is the same as the SHIFT-click or
     POWER-click. The terms "primary", "secondary", "SHIFT-" and
     "POWER-click" are explained in *Note Using the mouse::. See also the
     option `ecb-tree-do-not-leave-window-after-select' and the function
     `ecb-toggle-do-not-leave-window-after-select' which is bound to `C-t' in
     each tree-buffer of ECB!

     For all RETURN (and S-RETURN and C-RETURN) hits the position of the
     point within the current node-line is irrelevant! This is for
     conveniance.

   * TAB always expands or collapses expandable nodes.

The RETURN and TAB keys can not be (re)defined with `ecb-key-map'!

If you set `ecb-tree-navigation-by-arrow' to not nil then the arrow keys work
in the ECB tree-window in the following smart way:

   * Left-arrow: If node is expanded then it will be collapsed otherwise
     (i.e. current node is either not expandable or not expanded) point jumps
     to the next "higher" node in the hierarchical tree (higher means the
     next higher level or - if no higher level available - the next higher
     node on the same level).

   * Right-arrow: If node is expandable but not expanded then it will be
     expanded. Otherwise (i.e. current node is either not expandable or
     already expanded) point jumps to the next following node (which is the
     first subnode in case of an already expanded node or simply the next
     node in the following line).

   * Up- and down-arrow: Point jumps to the first character of the previous
     (up) rsp. next node (down). "First" character means either the first
     character of the expand-symbol (in case `ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before'
     is not nil) or of the displayed node-name. Or with other words: The
     first non-indentation and non-guide-line (see `ecb-tree-buffer-style')
     character of a node (*note Tree-buffer styles::).


File: ecb.info,  Node: Incremental search,  Next: Personal tree-keybindings,  Prev: Navigation/Selection,  Up: Using the keyboard

6.2.2 Incremental search for a node in current tree-buffer
----------------------------------------------------------

Each display-able key (e.g. all keys normally bound to `self-insert-command')
is appended to the current search-pattern. The tree-buffer tries to jump to
the first node which matching the current search-pattern either as substring
or as prefix (see below). If no match is found then nothing is done. There
are some special keys:

   * `backspace' and `delete': Delete the last character from the
     search-pattern.

   * `home': Delete the complete search-pattern

   * `end': Expand either to a complete node if current search-pattern is
     already unique or expands to the greatest common substring or prefix of
     the nodes. If there are at least two nodes with the same greatest
     common-prefix than every hit of `end' jumps to the next node with this
     common prefix.

For better overlooking the current search-pattern is shown in the echo area.
After selecting a node with RET the search-pattern is cleared out. With
`ecb-tree-incremental-search' you can specify if the current search-pattern
must be a real prefix of the node (default) or if any substring is matched.

For faster and easier finding the right node in a ecb-window the incremental
search ignores the following non interesting stuff:

   - any leading spaces

   - expand/collapse-buttons: [+] rsp. [-]

   - protection-signs (+, -, #) in the method-window if uml-notation is used

   - variables types or return-types in front of variable- or method-names.

   - const specifier for variables

This means: Just type in the prefix (rsp. a substring) of a class-,
variable-, method-, directory- or filename and ECB will bring you as fast as
possible to the node you want. Incremental node-search uses the value of
`case-fold-search'.

Tip: The `ecb-minor-mode' offers you in the `ecb-mode-map' (customizable via
`ecb-key-map') some keys for selecting every window of the ecb-frame. This
makes window-selection a child´s play. For example you can jump into the
method-window by hitting `C-c . gm'.

6.2.3 Adding personal keybindings for the tree-buffers
------------------------------------------------------

There are five hooks which can be used for adding personal keybindings to the
ECB tree-buffers:

   - `ecb-common-tree-buffer-after-create-hook'

   - `ecb-directories-buffer-after-create-hook'

   - `ecb-sources-buffer-after-create-hook'

   - `ecb-methods-buffer-after-create-hook'

   - `ecb-history-buffer-after-create-hook'

These hooks are called directly after tree-buffer creation so they can be
used to add personal local keybindings(1) either to all tree-buffers
(`ecb-common-tree-buffer-after-create-hook') or just to a certain
tree-buffer. Here is a list which keys MUST NOT be rebound:

   * `RET' and all combinations with `Shift' and `Ctrl': Used for selecting
     nodes in all tree-buffers.

   * `TAB': Used for expanding/collapsing nodes in all tree-buffers.

   * `C-t': Used for toggling "do not leave window after selection" in all
     tree-buffers, see command `ecb-toggle-do-not-leave-window-after-select'.

   * All self-inserting characters: Used for easy and fast navigation in all
     tree-buffers, *Note Incremental search::.

   * `F2', `F3', `F4': Used for customizing ECB, adding source-path in the
     directories buffer.

The following example binds `C-a' to some useful code in ALL tree-buffers and
`C-d' to even more useful code ONLY in the directories buffer:

   (add-hook 'ecb-common-tree-buffer-after-create-hook
             (lambda ()
                (local-set-key (kbd "C-a")
                               (lambda ()
                                  (interactive)
                                  (message "ECB is great!")))))

   (add-hook 'ecb-directories-buffer-after-create-hook
             (lambda ()
                (local-set-key (kbd "C-d")
                               (lambda ()
                                  (interactive)
                                  (message "ECB is wonderful!")))))

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) To be more general: They can be used to run any arbitrary lisp code after
a tree-buffer creation!

6.2.4 Using the popup-menu of a tree-buffer from keyboard.
----------------------------------------------------------

A popup-menu of a tree-buffer can be activated from keyboard with the command
`tree-buffer-show-menu-keyboard' which is bound to `M-m' in every
tree-buffer. How the popup-menu is displayed depends if this command is
called with a prefix-argument or not:

If called without a prefix-arg then the popup-menu is displayed graphically
as if it would be activated via mouse (for GNU Emacs this works perfectly but
for XEmacs there is a bug which results in a wrong menu-position - but the
menu itself works also with XEmacs).

If called with a prefix-arg (`C-u M-m') then the popup-menu is displayed with
the tmm-mechanism (like the Emacs-[menu-bar] is displayed when `tmm-menubar'
is called). This tmm-display is only available for GNU Emacs.

6.3 Working with the edit-window(s) of the edit-area
====================================================

ECB offers you all what you need to work with the edit-area as if the
edit-windows of the edit-area would be the only windows of the ECB-frame.

ECB advices the following user-commands so they work best with ECB:

   - `balance-windows'

   - `delete-other-windows'

   - `delete-window'

   - `delete-windows-on'

   - `display-buffer'

   - `shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer'

   - `split-window'

   - `split-window-horizontally'

   - `split-window-vertically'

   - `switch-to-buffer'

   - `switch-to-buffer-other-window'

   - `other-window'

   - `other-window-for-scrolling'

The behavior of the adviced functions is (slightly simplified):

   * All these adviced functions behaves exactly like their corresponding
     original functions but they always act as if the edit-window(s) of ECB
     would be the only window(s) of the ECB-frame. So the edit-window(s) of
     ECB seems to be a normal Emacs-frame to the user. This means that you
     can split and delete edit-windows without any restriction - ECB ensures
     that neither the special ECB-windows nor the compile-window will be
     damaged.

   * If there is a persistent compile-window (*note Temp- and
     compile-buffers::) then all compilation-buffers in the sense of
     `ecb-compilation-buffer-p' will be displayed in the compile-window.

   * If called in another frame than the ECB-frame these functions behave
     exactly like the not adviced original versions!

*Please note*: All these advices are only enabled when ECB is enabled.

Another interesting option in the context of the edit-window and these
adviced functions is `ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window'!

6.3.1 Documentation of the adviced window functions
---------------------------------------------------

This section describes for every adviced window function (s.a.) how it
differs from the original version. Only the differences are mentioned, so if
you want the full documentation of such a function call `describe-function'
or `C-h f'.

 -- Command: other-window ARG &optional ALL-FRAMES
     Around-advice `ecb': The ECB-version of `other-window'.  Works exactly
     like the original function with the following ECB-adjustment: The
     behavior depends on `ecb-other-window-behavior'.

 -- Command: delete-window &optional WINDOW
     Around-advice `ecb': The ECB-version of `delete-window'.  Works exactly
     like the original function with the following ECB-adjustment:

     If optional argument WINDOW is nil (i.e. probably called interactively):
     If called in a splitted edit-window then it works like as if all the
     edit-windows would be the only windows in the frame.  This means the
     current edit-window which contains the point will be destroyed and its
     place will be occupied from another one. If called in an unsplitted
     edit-window then nothing is done. If called in the compile-window of ECB
     then the compile-window will be hidden (like with
     `ecb-toggle-compile-window'). If called in an ecb-window of the current
     ECB-layout there are two alternatives:

        * If the function is contained in
          `ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window' the right edit-window is
          selected (depends on the value of the option
          `ecb-mouse-click-destination') and does then it´s job.

        * Otherwise the behavior depends on the value of the option
          `ecb-advice-window-functions-signal-error'.

     If optional argument WINDOW is a living window (i.e. called from
     program): If WINDOW is an edit-window then this window is deleted, if
     WINDOW is the compile-window then it will be hidden and otherwise the
     behavior depends on `ecb-advice-window-functions-signal-error'.

 -- Command: delete-other-windows &optional WINDOW
     Around-advice `ecb': The ECB-version of `delete-other-windows'. Works
     exactly like the original function with the following ECB-adjustment:

     If optional argument WINDOW is nil (i.e. probably called interactively):
     If called in a splitted edit-window then it works like as if all the
     edit-windows would be the only windows in the frame.  This means all
     other edit-windows besides the current edit-window which contains the
     point will be destroyed and the current edit-window fills the whole
     edit-area. Neither the special ecb-windows nor the compile-window will
     be destroyed!

        * If called in an unsplitted edit-window then either the
          compile-window will be hidden (if there is one) otherwise nothing
          is done.

        * If called in one of the ecb-windows then the current one is
          maximized, i.e. the other ecb-windows (not the edit-windows!) are
          deleted.

        * If called in the compile window there are two alternatives:

             - If the function is contained in
               `ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window' the right
               edit-window is selected (depends on the value of the option
               `ecb-mouse-click-destination') and then it does it´s job.

             - Otherwise the behavior depends on the value of the option
               `ecb-advice-window-functions-signal-error'.

     If optional argument WINDOW is a living window (i.e. called from
     program): If WINDOW is an edit-window then this window is maximized
     (i.e. the other edit-window is deleted) if there are more at least 2
     edit-windows otherwise the compile-window is deleted (if there is one).
     If WINDOW is an ecb-window then only the other ecb-windows are deleted
     and in all other cases the behavior depends on
     `ecb-advice-window-functions-signal-error'.

 -- Command: delete-windows-on BUFFER &optional FRAME
     Around-advice `ecb': The ECB-version of `delete-windows-on'.  Works
     exactly like the original function with the following ECB-adjustment:

     An error is reported if BUFFER is an ECB-tree-buffer. These windows are
     not allowed to be deleted.

 -- Command: split-window &optional WINDOW SIZE HORFLAG
     Around-advice `ecb': The ECB-version of `split-window'.  Works exactly
     like the original function with the following ECB-adjustment:

     If called for a not-edit-window in the `ecb-frame' it stops with an
     error if `split-window' is not contained in the option
     `ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window'! Besides this (e.g.  called
     for a window in another frame than the `ecb-frame') it behaves like the
     original version.

 -- Command: split-window-horizontally
     Around-advice `ecb': The ECB-version of `split-window-horizontally'.
     Works exactly like the original function with the following
     ECB-adjustment:

     If called in any other window of the current ECB-layout it stops with an
     error if this `split-window-horizontally' is not contained in the option
     `ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window'!

 -- Command: split-window-vertically
     Around-advice `ecb': The ECB-version of `split-window-vertically'. Works
     exactly like the original function with the following ECB-adjustment:

     If called in any other window of the current ECB-layout it stops with an
     error if this `split-window-vertically' is not contained in the option
     `ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window'!

 -- Command: display-buffer BUFFER &optional NOT-THIS-WINDOW FRAME
     Around-advice `ecb': Makes this function compatible with ECB if called
     in or for the ecb-frame. It displays all buffers which are
     "compilation-buffers" in the sense of `ecb-compilation-buffer-p' in the
     compile-window of ECB. If the compile-window is temporally hidden then
     it will be displayed first.

     If there is no compile-window (`ecb-compile-window-height' is nil) then
     it splits the edit-window if unsplitted and displays BUFFER in another
     edit-window but only if `pop-up-windows' is not nil (otherwise the
     edit-window will not be splitted).

     All buffers which are not "compilation-buffers" in the sense of
     `ecb-compilation-buffer-p' will be displayed in one of the edit-area and
     `display-buffer' behaves as if the edit-windows would be the only
     windows in the frame.

     If BUFFER is contained in `special-display-buffer-names' or matches
     `special-display-regexps' then `special-display-function' will be called
     (if not nil). But this behavior depends on the value of the option
     `ecb-ignore-special-display'. The values of `same-window-buffer-names'
     and `same-window-regexps' are supported as well.

     See the option `ecb-ignore-display-buffer-function'!

     If called for other frames it works like the original version.

 -- Command: switch-to-buffer BUFFER &optional NORECORD
     Around-advice `ecb': The ECB-version of `switch-to-buffer'.  Works
     exactly like the original but with the following enhancements for ECB:

     "compilation-buffers" in the sense of `ecb-compilation-buffer-p' will be
     displayed always in the compile-window of ECB (if
     `ecb-compile-window-height' is not nil) - if the compile-window is
     temporally hidden then it will be displayed first. If you do not want
     this you have to modify the options `ecb-compilation-buffer-names',
     `ecb-compilation-major-modes' or `ecb-compilation-predicates'.

     If called for non "compilation-buffers" (s.a.) from outside the
     edit-area of ECB it behaves as if called from an edit-window if
     `switch-to-buffer' is contained in the option
     `ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window'. Otherwise an error is
     reported.

 -- Command: switch-to-buffer-other-window BUFFER &optional FRAME
     Around-advice `ecb': The ECB-version of `switch-to-buffer-other-window'.
     Works exactly like the original but with some adaptions for ECB so this
     function works in a "natural" way:

     If called in any special ecb-window of the current ECB-layout then it
     goes always to an edit-window (which one depends on the setting in
     `ecb-mouse-click-destination') and then goes on as if called from this
     edit-window.

     If a compile-window is used (i.e. `ecb-compile-window-height' is not
     nil) then "compilation-buffers" in the sense of
     `ecb-compilation-buffer-p' are always displayed in the compile-window.
     If the compile-window is temporally hidden then it will be displayed
     first. If no compile-window is used it behaves like the original.

     If called from within the compile-window then "compilation-buffers" will
     be displayed still there and all other buffers are displayed in one of
     the edit-windows - if the destination-buffer is already displayed in one
     of the edit-windows then this one is used otherwise it behaves like the
     original.

     If called within an edit-window it behaves like the original function
     except for compilation-buffers (if a compile-window is used, see above).

 -- Function: other-window-for-scrolling
     Around-advice `ecb': This function determines the window which is
     scrolled if any of the "other-window-scrolling-functions" is called
     (e.g. `scroll-other-window'):

     If the option `ecb-scroll-other-window-scrolls-compile-window' is not
     nil (maybe set by `ecb-toggle-scroll-other-window-scrolls-compile') and a
     compile-window is visible then always the current buffer in the
     compile-window is scrolled!

     Otherwise it depends completely on the setting in
     `ecb-other-window-behavior'.

 -- Command: balance-windows
     Around-advice `ecb': When called in the `ecb-frame' then only the
     edit-windows are balanced.

6.4 Temp- and compile-buffers display in ECB
============================================

If you call any help in Emacs, e.g. by calling `describe-function', or if you
do a completion in the minibuffer, then Emacs displays the result-buffer in
another window. This behavior you have also in ECB.

6.4.1 Standard Emacs behavior
-----------------------------

If the edit-area is already splitted into at least two edit-windows then the
temp-buffer is displayed in another edit-window otherwise the edit-area will
be splitted first into two edit-windows, one above the other. The variables
`temp-buffer-max-height' and `temp-buffer-resize-mode' (for GNU Emacs) and
`temp-buffer-shrink-to-fit' (for XEmacs) work also correctly with ECB.

Same for all compilation output-buffers (e.g. after a `compile' or `grep')
and the variable `compilation-window-height'.

This is default behavior of ECB. But there is also another way to display
such buffers: Using a persistent extra window at the bottom of the ECB-frame:

6.4.2 Using a persistent compile window
---------------------------------------

With the option `ecb-compile-window-height' you can define if the ECB layout
should contain per default a compile-window at the bottom (just specify the
number of lines which should be used for the compile-window at the bottom of
the frame). If "yes" ECB displays all buffers for which the function
`ecb-compilation-buffer-p' returns not nil (e.g. all output of
compilation-mode (compile, grep etc.) or all temp-buffers like
*Help*-buffers) in this special window.

In general: With the options `ecb-compilation-buffer-names',
`ecb-compilation-major-modes' and `ecb-compilation-predicates' you can define
which buffers should be displayed in the compile-window of ECB (for example
if you call `switch-to-buffer' or `display-buffer' or if you run `compile' or
if you display *Help*-buffers). Per default these are all temp-buffers like
*Help*-buffers, all compile- and grep buffers, *Occur*-buffers etc. See the
default values of these options.

With the command `ecb-toggle-compile-window' (bound to `C-c .  \') you can
toggle the visibility of the compile-window (*note Interactive ECB
commands::).

There are some more useful options and commands related to the compile-window
of ECB (to see all options for the compile-window see the customization group
*Note ecb-compilation::):

   * With the option `ecb-compile-window-temporally-enlarge' you can allow
     Emacs to enlarge temporally the ECB-compile-window in some situations.
     Please read the comment of this option. See also the description of the
     command `ecb-toggle-compile-window-height'.

   * With the option `ecb-enlarged-compilation-window-max-height' you specify
     how `ecb-toggle-compile-window-height' should enlarge the compile-window.

   * With the command `ecb-cycle-through-compilation-buffers' (*note
     Interactive ECB commands::) you can cycle through all current open
     compilation-buffers (in the sense of `ecb-compilation-buffer-p') very
     fast.

ECB offers the same compile-window functionality regardless if the ECB-window
are hidden or not. The state of the compile-window will be preserved when
toggling the ecb-windows or when maximizing one ecb-windows! So you have the
advantage of one special window for all help-, grep or compile-output (see
above) also when the ecb-windows are hidden - a window which will not be
deleted if you call `delete-other-windows' (bound to `C-x 1') for one of the
edit-windows. In general: All features of the compile-window work with hidden
ecb-windows exactly as when the ecb-windows are visible.

6.4.3 What to do if there are problems with the compile-window
--------------------------------------------------------------

Normally displaying temp- and compilation-buffers (or more general:
displaying buffer for which `ecb-compilation-buffer-p' is not nil) should
work reliable. But if there are problems which you can not handle with the
options `ecb-compilation-buffer-names', `ecb-compilation-major-modes' or
`ecb-compilation-predicates' then please go on like follows:

  1. Set the option `ecb-layout-debug-mode' to not nil.

  2. Reproduce the wrong behavior exactly by repeating all the operations
     which lead to the problem. If possible then restart Emacs before
     reproducing the problem so you can begin from the beginning!

  3. Now send immediately a bug report with `ecb-submit-problem-report'.

  4. Set `ecb-layout-debug-mode' back to nil if you do not want further
     debugging output in the *Messages* buffer"

6.4.4 Handling special-display-buffers
--------------------------------------

Emacs offers three options for a special-display-handling of certain buffers:
`special-display-function', `special-display-buffer-names' and
`special-display-regexps' (see the Emacs manual for a description of these
options). ECB offers an option `ecb-ignore-special-display' for specification
in which situations ECB should take account for the values of these
special-display-options.

Default-behavior of ECB is to ignore these special-display-options when a
persistent compile-window is active (i.e.  `ecb-compile-window-height' is not
nil). But with `ecb-ignore-special-display' you can tell ECB, that either
always the special-display-options should be ignored as long as ECB is active
or that they should be never igored regardless if a persistent compile-window
is set or not. In the latter case using `display-buffer' or `pop-to-buffer'
takes always account for the values of these options - like the original
behavior of Emacs.

6.5 How the "other window" is determined by ECB
===============================================

Normally all windows in an Emacs-frame are arranged in a cyclic order and
window-selecting-commands like `other-window' or window-scrolling-commands
like `scroll-other-window' choose simply the next(1) window after the current
window as "other window".

6.5.1 "Other window"-basics in ECB
----------------------------------

With a typical window-layout of ECB such a cyclic order of *all* windows in
the ECB-frame does not make sense because it would be not very intuitive and
against that what the user wants to "say" when calling `other-window' or
`scroll-other-window'.

Therefore ECB divides the whole set of windows of the ECB-frame in several
subsets:

   * The edit-windows of the edit-area

   * The special tree-windows for browsing-tasks

   * The compile-window at the bottom (if there is one)

   * The minibuffer-window of the ECB-frame (if active)

Each of these subsets will be treated as a cyclic ordered subset, i.e.  all
windows in each of these subsets are ordered as the function `walk-windows'
would visit the windows when the windows of a subset would be the only
windows of a frame(2).

6.5.2 Builtin "other window" behaviors of ECB
---------------------------------------------

ECB now offers to specify the behavior of commands like `other-window' or
`scroll-other-window' within the ECB-frame. This can be done with the option
`ecb-other-window-behavior'. This option offers several builtin behaviors:

   * All windows of the ECB-frame are considered

     ECB will cycle through all windows of the ECB-frame or scroll simply the
     next window in the ECB-frame, means it behaves like the original
     `other-window' rsp. the original `other-window-for-scrolling'.

   * Only the windows of the edit-area are considered

     ECB will only cycle through the edit-windows of ECB or only scroll
     another edit-window. If the selected window is not an edit-window then
     all windows are taken into account.

   * The edit-windows and the compile-window are considered

     Like above but the compile-window will be added to the subset of the
     edit-windows.

   * Behave as smart and intuitive as possible

     This is the default behavior of ECB. ECB tries to choose the
     `other-window'-destination or the "other window" to scroll in a smart
     and intuitive way: If point is in one of the edit-windows and if the
     edit-area is splitted then always the "next" edit-window is choosen
     (whereas the next edit-window of the last edit-window is the first
     edit-window)- if the edit-area is unsplitted then the compile-window is
     used if there is one. In the context of an `other-window'-call the ARG
     of `other-window' will be taken into account.

     If one of the special ecb-windows is selected then always the "next"
     ecb-window is choosen (whereas the next ecb-window of the last
     ecb-window is the first ecb-window). In the context of an
     `other-window'-call the ARG of `other-window' will be taken into
     account. If there is only one ecb-window then ECB considers also the
     edit-windows.

     If the compile-window is selected then always the last edit-window which
     had the point will be used unless `other-window' has been called with a
     prefix-argument unequal 1.

Regardless of the different behaviors above ECB handles the situation of an
active minibuffer during a call to `other-window' or `scroll-other-window'
like follows:

If the minibuffer-window is selected then ECB always chooses the window
`minibuffer-scroll-window' points to (when this variable is set, otherwise
the compile-window or the last selected edit-window is choosen) when the
called command is called to choose the 1. next window (always true for
scrolling another window or true when `other-window' called without
prefix-arg or with prefix-arg equal 1). Otherwise the window ARG steps away
is choosen (in case of `other-window').

If there is an active minibuffer but the minibuffer-window is not selected
then `other-window' and `scroll-other-window' behave like the original
version.

6.5.3 User-defined "other window" behavior
------------------------------------------

In addition to the builtin "other window" behaviors ECB offers a user to
completely define for himself how ECB should choose another window for
scrolling it or selecting it. This can be done with the option
`ecb-other-window-behavior' too because this option can also have a
function-symbol as value:

Such a function gets seven arguments:
  1. A canonical list of all currently visible windows of the `ecb-frame'

  2. A canonical list of all currently visible edit-windows

  3. A canonical list of all currently visible ecb-windows

  4. The window-object of the compile-window if there is any.

  5. The minibuffer-window of the ECB-frame if there is an active minibuffer.

  6. The result of the function `ecb-where-is-point' - see the documentation
     of this function for details.

  7. An integer which indicates how many steps away from the current selected
     window the "other-window" is. Is nil when this function is called in
     another context than for `other-window'.

The function has to return a window-object which is then used as "other
window" for the command `other-window' or for scrolling another window (e.g.
with `scroll-other-window'). Such a function has to handle properly all
situation for itself.

Here is an example for such a function:

   (defun ecb-get-other-window-smart (win-list
                                      edit-win-list

                                      nth-window)
     "Implements the smart-setting of `ecb-other-window-behavior'."
     (if minibuf-win
         ;; if we have an active mini-buffer we delegate this to
         ;; `ecb-get-other-window-minibuf-active'
         (ecb-get-other-window-minibuf-active win-list
                                              edit-win-list

         (cond ((equal point-loc 'ecb)
                (ecb-next-listelem ecb-win-list (selected-window) nth-win))
               ((equal point-loc 'compile)
                (if (= nth-win 1)
                    (or (and ecb-last-edit-window-with-point
                             (window-live-p ecb-last-edit-window-with-point)
                             ecb-last-edit-window-with-point)
                        (car edit-win-list))
                  (ecb-next-listelem (append edit-win-list
                                             (list (selected-window)))
                                     (selected-window)
                                     nth-win)))
               (t ;; must be an edit-window
                (ecb-next-listelem (append edit-win-list
                                           (if (and comp-win
                                                    (= (length edit-win-list)
                                                       1))
                                               (list comp-win)))
                                   (selected-window)
                                   nth-win))))))

This example implements the builtin smart behavior described above.

6.6 Using and customizing the ECB-Methods buffer
================================================

ECB is mostly designed to display parsing information for files supported by
semantic. But beginning with version 1.94 it also supports other parsing
engines like imenu and etags, so also files not supported by semantic but by
imenu/etags can be displayed in the Method-buffer of ECB. Therefore we have
to introduce some terminology:

   - "semantic-sources": These are file-types for which a semantic grammar is
     available, so the files are parse-able by semantic. These sources are
     supported best by ECB and most of the following options and descriptions
     are related to these file-types. Examples are programming-sources like
     C++, C, Java, Emacs-Lisp and Texinfo-file and some more.

   - "non-semantic-sources": For these files there is no semantic-grammar
     available so they can not be parsed by semantic. Examples are Perl-,
     LaTeX- and TeX-files. But for many of these files imenu and/or etags
     parsers exist. ECB supports now parsing and displaying these file-types
     too and it uses for this some speedbar-logic.

This chapter describes how to use and customize the Methods-buffer of ECB.

* Rebuilding the Methods::      When to rebuild the Methods-buffer


File: ecb.info,  Node: Visiting tags,  Next: Expanding,  Prev: The Methods buffer,  Up: The Methods buffer

6.6.1 Possible actions after visiting a tag
-------------------------------------------

You visit a tag by clicking with either the primary oder secondary
mouse-button (or by hitting `RET' or `C-RET' if using the keyboard) onto a
node in the Methods-tree-buffer of ECB. This simply selects the "right"
edit-window (depends if clicked with the primary or secondary button, in how
many windows the edit-area is splitted and the value of
`ecb-mouse-click-destination') and puts the point onto the first line of the
clicked tag.

But you can define if after this "basic" tag-visit-action more additional
actions should be performed by ECB. You can either use some of the predefined
actions (e.g. highlighting the header-line of the tag) or define own actions.
You can set different actions for different major-modes. All this is done via
the option `ecb-tag-visit-post-actions'.

The following actions are currently predefined:
   - `ecb-tag-visit-highlight-tag-header'

   - `ecb-tag-visit-smart-tag-start'

   - `ecb-tag-visit-recenter'

   - `ecb-tag-visit-recenter-top'

   - `ecb-tag-visit-goto-doc-start'

   - `ecb-tag-visit-narrow-tag'

See the documentation of these function for details what they do.

Per default ECB performs the actions `ecb-tag-visit-smart-tag-start' and
`ecb-tag-visit-highlight-tag-header' for all major-modes.


File: ecb.info,  Node: Expanding,  Next: Customizing the display,  Prev: Visiting tags,  Up: The Methods buffer

6.6.2 Explicit and automatic expanding of the ECB-methods-buffer
----------------------------------------------------------------

6.6.2.1 Explicit expanding all nodes to a certain expansion level
.................................................................

With the command `ecb-expand-methods-nodes' (bound to `C-c .  x') you can get
a fast overlook of the contents of the source-buffer, because this command
allows precisely expanding all tags with a certain indentation-level. So you
can either expand no tags (or with other words collapse all tags) or expand
all tags so see the contents of a buffer at one glance. Or you can expand
exactly that tags of a certain indentation level.

Which node-types are expanded (rsp. collapsed) by this command depends for
semantic-sources on the options `ecb-methods-nodes-expand-spec' and
`ecb-methods-nodes-collapse-spec'! For non-semantic-sources always all
node-types are expanded/collapsed, i.e. the two options above takes no effect
for these files.

6.6.2.2 Explicit expanding of the current node to a certain level
.................................................................

With the popup-menu of the methods-buffer an even more precise expansion is
possible because it allows not only expanding all tags (see above) but offers
in addition expanding only the current-node (for which the menu was
activated) to an exact level of expansion:

All menu-entries are label with an expansion-"level" whereas level specifies
precisely which level of nodes should be expanded. level means the
indentation-level of the NODE itself and its (recursive) subnodes relative to
the NODE itself.

So a level value X means that all (sub)nodes with an indentation-level <= X
relative to NODE are expanded and all other are collapsed.

Examples:

   - Expand this node to level 0: Expand only the NODE itself because it is
     the only node which has indentation 0 to itself. All deeper indented
     nodes will be collapsed.  This is also the important difference between
     using this menu compared to clicking onto the expand-symbol of the node:
     The latter one expands the NODE to that expansion-state it has before
     the last collapsing (so when deeper nodes has been expanded they will be
     expanded now to). The former one expands exactly(!) to level 0, means
     expand only the node itself and collapse all(!) its subnodes
     recursively(!).

   - Expand this node to level 1: Expand the NODE itself and all of its
     direct subnodes - because only the direct subnodes of NODE have
     indentation-level 1 relativ to NODE.  All deeper nodes will be collapsed.

   - Collapse this node completely: Collapses the current node recursively,
     means collapse not only the node itself but also its subnodes, the
     subnodes of the subnodes and so on! This is very differnt from clicking
     onto the collapse symbol because this action only collapses the node
     itself but preserves the expansion-state of all its subnodes!


Expanding the current node with the popup-menu ignores the settings in the
options `ecb-methods-nodes-expand-spec' and `ecb-methods-nodes-collapse-spec'!

6.6.2.3 Automatic expansion ot tags after buffer-parsing
........................................................

With the option `ecb-show-tags' you tell ECB how to display tags of a certain
tag-class (*note Customizing the display::). Among other things you can tell
ECB that a certain tag-class should be combined under an expanded or
collapsed bucket-node. But such a setting defines the expansion-state of such
a bucket-node only direct afterwards the buffer has been (re)parsed, which
can occur after opening a file, after autom. reparsing the buffer via
semantic or after manually rebuilding the methods-buffer of ECB.

The tag-class `type' (classes, interfaces, enumerations etc.) is divided into
several subtypes by semantic. The subtypes are strings which names exactly if
the tag with tag-class `type' is a class, an interface, an enumeration, a
typedef etc. With the option `ecb-type-tag-expansion' you can tell ECB if
these type-tags should be autom. expanded after (reparsing) a buffer (see
above) or if they should be displayed collapsed - so all its members (methods,
variables etc.) are hidden.

6.6.2.4 Automatic expanding the ECB-methods-buffer for current tag
..................................................................

If the option `ecb-highlight-tag-with-point' is switched on, then always that
node in the method-buffer is highlighted which belongs to the current
semantic-tag under point in the current active edit-window. But if this node
is invisible (probably because its parent node is collapsed) then no node is
highlighted if the auto.  expanding feature is switched off.

You can either switch on this feature with the option
`ecb-auto-expand-tag-tree' or even easier with the command
`ecb-toggle-auto-expand-tag-tree'.

There is another option `ecb-expand-methods-switch-off-auto-expand' which
makes both explicit and auto. expanding best working together. See the
documentation of this option to get the details.

The autom. expanding feature is only available for semantic-sources!

Previous versions of ECB have always fully expanded the whole tree in the
Methods-buffer if the current tag in the source-buffer was not visible in the
current tree - e.g. because the variables-bucket was collapsed or the
containing type of a tag (e.g. the class of a method) was collapsed. So in
most cases much more was expanded as needed to make the current tag visible.

The mechanism of ECB 2.22 and higher only expands the needed parts of the
tree-buffer to make the related node visible: First we try to highlight the
current tag with current expansion-state of the Methods-buffer. If the node
is not visible so the tag can not be highlighted then we go upstairs the
ladder of type-tags the current tag belongs to (e.g. we expand successive the
nodes of the whole class-hierachy of the current method-tag until the related
node becomes visible). If there is no containing type for the current tag
then the node of the tag is probably contained in a toplevel-bucket which is
currently collapsed; in this case we expand only this bucket-node and try
highlighting again. Only if this has still no success then we expand the full
tree-buffer and try to highlight the current tag.

There is another option `ecb-auto-expand-tag-tree-collapse-other': If this
option is set then auto. expanding the tag-tree collapses all not related
nodes.  This means that all nodes which have no relevance for the currently
highlighted node will be collapsed, because they are not necessary to make
the highlighted node visible. This feature is switched off by default because
if always collapses the complete Methods-tree before the following
highlighting of the node for the current tag expands the needed parts of the
tree-buffer.

6.6.3 Customizing the display of the Methods-buffer
---------------------------------------------------

The ECB-Methods buffer is probably the most important browsing window offered
by ECB. It displays all parsing informations of the current source-buffer
(the buffer displayed in the current active edit-window).

Normally ECB gets all informations displayed in this Methods-buffer from the
semantic-library - at least for semantic-sources. This library parses auto.
the current source-buffer in the edit-window of ECB and returns all
information in form of "tags" to ECB which displays them in a browse-able
form in its Method-buffer. See *Note ECB Methods-buffer:: for information how
to use the Methods-buffer.

There are several options to customize which tags ECB should display in
general, if the tags should be collapsed or expanded, how to fontify them
(i.e. syntax-highlighting) and something more.

`ecb-show-tags'
     With the option `ecb-show-tags' you specify how ECB should display the
     tags returned by the semantic parser. Semantic divides its tags in
     several so called "tag classes". A tag-class is always a symbol and can
     be for example `type' (tags which represent a class(1), a interface, an
     enumeration etc.), `function' (tags which represent function or methods),
     `variable' (variables and attributes), `include' (import-statements)
     etc. There is no predefined superset of allowed tag-class-symbols
     because each language-parser can define its own tag-classes. But to get
     an overview of the most common tag-classes see the default value of the
     option `ecb-show-tags'.

     With the option `ecb-show-tags' you can now specify how ECB should
     display tags of a certain tag-class in a certain major-mode.  You can
     tell ECB that all tags of a tag-class `X' should be displayed in an
     expanded bucket and all tags of a tag-class `Y' should be displayed in a
     collapsed bucket and all tags of a tag-class `Z' should be displayed
     flattened (means not contained in a expandable/collapsable bucket-node).
     These settings can be made separately for each major-mode but you can
     also define a default-display which takes effect when for a major-mode
     no special setting can be found in `ecb-show-tags'.

     For every tag-class you can tell ECB how the tags should be sorted.

`ecb-font-lock-tags'
`ecb-type-tag-display'
     How to fontify the tags in the Method-buffer

`ecb-tag-display-function'
     ECB and semantic offer several predefined functions for displaying the
     tags. Here you can customize, what informations tags should contain
     (only the method-name or the whole signature or something else) and what
     notation should be used, e.g. UML or not.


These are the most important options for this topic but it is recommended to
have a look into the customize-group `ecb-methods' (*note ecb-methods::) and
check all the options offered there!

All these options are only relevant for semantic-sources and take no effect
for non-semantic-sources!

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) Do not confuse the term "class" in the context of a tag, which means the
class of the tag and which is a semantic-term and a "class" in the context of
an object oriented language like Java or C++! Normally the surrounding
context sould be sufficient to understand which type of "class" is meant
whenever the term "class" is used in this manual.

6.6.4 Rebuilding the Methods-buffer
-----------------------------------

In almost all cases there is *NO* need to manually rebuild the method-buffer,
because it is always done automatically if necessary; the mechanism depends
on the sources:

   - semantic-sources: The command `global-semantic-auto-parse-mode' switches
     on autom.  reparsing of semantic-sources.

   - non-semantic-sources (imenu supported): You can switch on autom.
     rescanning/reparsing with the option `imenu-auto-rescan'. But
     nevertheless you have to manually rebuild the Method-buffer (with the
     autom. updated imenu-tags) via the command `ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer'
     (bound to `C-c . r').

   - non-semantic-sources (etags supported): For these sources there is no
     built-in auto-rescan mechanism, because etags is an external tool it can
     only operate on the saved file-contents. So rescanning the buffer
     contents would need to save the buffer before. Therefore there is no
     built-in auto-rescan mechanism because this would always result in
     saving the buffer and running an external tool. But of course you can
     program such a an etags-auto-rescan mechanism for yourself!

Besides for etags-supported non-semantic-sources there exist a few rare
scenarios also for the other sources where a complete manual rebuild can be
necessary. Here is one example:

Depending on the semantic-version: If an Elisp-file is parsed which contains
a defun X in the middle where the closing ) is missing, then semantic parses
only until this defun X is reached and you will get an incomplete ECB-method
buffer. In such a case you must complete the defun X and then completely
reparse the Elisp-file and rebuild the ECB method buffer!

A complete manually rebuild is done by `ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer'. For
etags-parsed non-semantic-sources this causes an automatic saving of the
source-buffer because otherwise etags would not operate with the latest
contents!

6.7 Applying filters to the special ECB-tree-buffers
====================================================

To get a fast and good overlook of the contents of a tree-buffer ECB offers a
filter-mechanism for the Directories-, Sources-, the History- and the
Methods-buffer.

* Menu:

* Filtering Directories::       Applying filters to the Directories-buffer
* Filtering Sources::           Applying filters to the Sources--buffer
* Filtering History::           Applying filters to the History-buffer
* Filtering Methods::           Applying filters to the Methods-buffer


File: ecb.info,  Node: Filtering Directories,  Next: Filtering Sources,  Prev: Filtering the tree-buffers,  Up: Filtering the tree-buffers

6.7.1 Applying filters to the Directories-buffer
------------------------------------------------

With the option `ecb-excluded-directories-regexps' certain directories can be
excluded from being displayed in the directories-browser of ECB. This can be
done by defining regular expressions. If the name of a directory matches at
least one of the regexps of this option the directory is not displayed in the
directories-tree-buffer.

The option `ecb-sources-exclude-cvsignore' allows to exclude source-files
from the sources-tree-buffer if their name is listed in a so called
`.cvsignore'-file. This option is a list of regular expressions and if a
directory-name matches at least one of these regexps then all files listed in
the `.cvsignore'-file of this directory are not displayed in the
sources-tree-buffer.

6.7.2 Applying filters to the Sources-buffer
--------------------------------------------

6.7.2.1 Interactive Sources-filters
...................................

The command `ecb-sources-filter' allows to filter these tree-buffer either by
a regular expression or by an extension (e.g.  java, cc, el for java-, c++-
rsp elisp-sources). This functionality is also available via the popup-menu
of the Sources-tree-buffer.

The currently applied filter is indicated in the modeline of the related
tree-buffer. Applying a new filter replaces an eventually already applied
filter.

6.7.2.2 Default Sources-filters
...............................

The option `ecb-source-file-regexps' allow to specify which source-files
should be displayed and which not. This is done on a directory-basis, ie. for
each directory-regexp the files to display can be specified. See the
documentation of this option for all details.

In addition to this option you should also know the option
`ecb-sources-exclude-cvsignore' (*note Filtering Directories::).

6.7.3 Applying filters to the History-buffer
--------------------------------------------

6.7.3.1 Interactive History-filters
...................................

The command `ecb-history-filter' allows to filter these tree-buffer either by
a regular expression or by an extension (e.g.  java, cc, el for java-, c++-
rsp elisp-sources). This functionality is also available via the popup-menu
of the History-tree-buffer.

The currently applied filter is indicated in the modeline of the related
tree-buffer. Applying a new filter replaces an eventually already applied
filter.

6.7.3.2 Default History-filters
...............................

The option `ecb-history-exclude-file-regexps' allows to exclude source-files
from being historized (ie. displayed in the History-buffer). Despite the fact
that the History-buffer already excludes all non-file-buffers there can be
still buffers which name you do not wat to be displayed in the history. These
are file-buffer like `TAGS' or `semantic.cache' which store meta-informations
used by Emacs and its tools (etags, semantic etc.).  These files can be
excluded via `ecb-history-exclude-file-regexps'.

6.7.4 Applying filters to the Methods-buffer
--------------------------------------------

The commands `ecb-methods-filter', `ecb-methods-filter-regexp',
`ecb-methods-filter-protection', `ecb-methods-filter-tagclass',
`ecb-methods-filter-function', `ecb-methods-filter-delete-last',
`ecb-methods-filter-nofilter' allows to filter the tags/nodes of the
Methods-buffer by several criterias. As for the Sources- and the
History-buffer the same functionality is also available via the popup-menu of
the Methods-buffer.

6.7.4.1 Possible filter-criterias
.................................

   * Filter by protection: Just insert the protection you want the
     Methods-buffer being filtered: private, protected or public! For sources
     not supported by semantic the protection filter will not be offered
     because these informations are not available for such sources.

   * Filter by regexp: Insert the filter as regular expression.

   * Filter by tag-class: You can filter by tag-classes. The popup-menu
     contains mode-dependend tag-filter entries and the command
     `ecb-methods-filter' offers only the tag-classes of the current mode.
     This means for sources not supported by semantic the tag-class filter
     will not be offered. And for semantic-supported sources exactly these
     tag-classes are offered the semantic-parser for the current major-mode
     offers. For example texi-sources can only be filtered by the tag-classes
     "Definitions" and "Sections" and java-sources can be filtered by
     "Methods", "Variables", "Classes" etc. In general the semantic-variable
     `semantic-symbol->name-assoc-list' is used to get the right tag-classes.

   * Filter by a filter-function: Such a function gets two arguments: a tag
     and the source-buffer of this tag. If the tag should be displayed (i.e.
     not being filtered out) then the function has to return not nil
     otherwise nil.

   * No special filter: This means to display all tags specified with the
     option `ecb-show-tokens'. If currently some of the above filters are
     applied they will be all removed.

   * Delete the last added: This removes only the topmost filter-layer, means
     that filter added last.

Be aware that the tag-list specified by the option `ecb-show-tags' is the
basis of all filters, i.e. tags which are excluded by that option will never
be shown regardless of the filter type here!

All tags which match the applied filter(s) will be displayed in the
Methods-buffer. Such a filter is only applied to the current source-buffer,
i.e. each source-buffer can have its own tag-filters.

These tag-filters can also applied to sources which are not supported by the
semantic-parser but "only" by imenu or etags. But because for these sources
not all information are avaiable the protection- and tag-class filter are not
offered with such "non-semantic"-sources.  See *Note Non-semantic sources::
for further details about working with source-files not supported by the
semantic-parser.

6.7.4.2 Inverse Filters
.......................

But if `ecb-methods-filter' is called with a prefix-argument then an inverse
filter is applied to the Methods-buffer, i.e. all tags which do *NOT* match
the choosen filter will be displayed in the Methods-buffer!

6.7.4.3 Layered filters
.......................

Per default the choosen filter will be applied on top of already existing
filters. This means that filters applied before are combined with the new
filter. This behavior can changed via the option
`ecb-methods-filter-replace-existing'.

6.7.4.4 Display of currently applied filters
............................................

The current active filter will be displayed in the modeline of the
Methods-buffer [regexp, prot (= protection), tag-class, function (=
filter-function)]. If an inverse filter has been applied then this is
signalized by a preceding caret ^. If currently more than 1 filter is applied
then always the top-most filter is displayed in the modeline but the fact of
more than 1 filter is visualized by the number of the filters - included in
parens. You can see all currently applied filters by moving the mouse over
the filter-string in modeline of the Methods-buffer: They will displayed as
help-echo.

6.7.4.5 Default filters for certain files.
..........................................

The new option `ecb-default-tag-filter' allow to define default tag-filters
for certain files which are applied automatically after loading such a file
into a buffer. The possible filters are the same as offered by the command
`ecb-methods-filter' and they are applied in the same manner - the only
difference is they are applied automatically. The files can be specified on a
combined major-mode- and filename-regexp-basis.

Usage-example: This can be used to display in outline-mode files (e.g.
`NEWS') only the level-1-headings by defining a filter regexp "^\* .*".

6.8 Changing, customizing, redrawing and creating layouts
=========================================================

The term "ECB-layout" means in which windows the ECB-frame is divided. This
chapter describes all aspects concerning this layout, especially changing,
customizing, redrawing and also creating new layouts.

6.8.1 Changing and customizing the ECB-layout
---------------------------------------------

ECB offers several predefined layouts with different sets and also different
locations of ECB-windows. See below the "ascii-screenshot" of all currently
built-in layouts(1).

In addition to these predefined layouts you can either interactively create
new layouts "by example" (*note Creating a new ECB-layout::) or program new
layouts with the macro `ecb-layout-define' (*note The layout-engine::). The
former method is the recommended one!

There are two ways to interactively change the layout:
   * Changing permanently: Customize the option `ecb-layout-name' and store
     it for future Emacs sessions.

   * Switching between several layouts at runtime: If you want to switch fast
     between a certain sequence of layouts see the option
     `ecb-toggle-layout-sequence' and the command `ecb-toggle-layout' (*note
     Simulating speedbar::). For just selecting another layout during current
     Emacs-session use the command `ecb-change-layout'.

With the option `ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer' you can define if
sources are displayed in the directory-window of a layout (*note ECB
Directories-buffer::).

In addition to the general layout you can specify if the layout should
contain a persistent compilation-window at the bottom of the frame, see
`ecb-compile-window-height' (*note Temp- and compile-buffers::).

Maybe you want also change the look&feel of the tree-buffers. Then you can
change the general style of the tree-buffers with the option
`ecb-tree-buffer-style' and the location of the collapse- and expand-symbols
and the indentation of sub-nodes in a tree. See `ecb-tree-indent' and
`ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before'. More details about the different
tree-buffer-styles are described in *Note Tree-buffer styles::.

Here are all currently available layouts (for creating own new layouts see
*Note Creating a new ECB-layout::); just customize the option
`ecb-layout-name' to the related name:

6.8.2 Redrawing the ECB-layout
------------------------------

If you have unintentionally destroyed the ECB-layout, you can always restore
the layout with calling `ecb-redraw-layout'. This is even true, if you get
messages like "wrong-type-argument window-live-p #<window 222>".

If the variable `ecb-redraw-layout-quickly' is not nil then the redraw is
done by the `ecb-redraw-layout-quickly' function, otherwise by
`ecb-redraw-layout-full'. But it's strongly recommended to use the quick
redraw only if you have really slow machines where a full redraw takes
several seconds because the quick redraw is not really safe and may have some
drawbacks! On normal machines the full redraw should be done in << 1s!

Please read the documentation of the command `ecb-redraw-layout'!

See also the hooks `ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook' and
`ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook'!

6.8.3 Changing the sizes of the special ECB-windows
---------------------------------------------------

The standard width and height of the special ECB-windows is defined with the
options `ecb-windows-width' and `ecb-windows-height'. But changing these
options always influences all layouts which is not always desired.

ECB offers to re-adjust the width and height of the ECB-windows (e.g. by
dragging the windows-borders via the mouse) and then saving exactly these
current window-sizes for the current layout so after activating this layout
all windows have autom. the stored sizes.

This is done via the option `ecb-layout-window-sizes' and the commands
`ecb-store-window-sizes', `ecb-restore-window-sizes' and
`ecb-restore-default-window-sizes'.

Here is an example how to resize and store the sizes of the ECB-windows of
layout "left1":

  1. Switch to layout "left1" via `ecb-change-layout' (`C-c . lc')

  2. Resize the ECB-windows by dragging the window-borders with the mouse

  3. Call `ecb-store-window-sizes'

After this layout "left1" will be always drawn with the new sizes until you
call `ecb-restore-default-window-sizes' during layout "left1" is active.

*Please note*: `ecb-store-window-sizes' stores the width and height of the
windows per default as fractions of the width (rsp.  height) of the
ECB-frame, so the stored sizes are always correct regardless of the current
frame-size! But if called with a prefix argument then fixed sizes are stored.

6.8.4 Fixing the sizes of the special ECB-windows
-------------------------------------------------

GNU Emacs 21 introduced a new feature which can fix the sizes of a window
displaying a certain buffer even after resizing the frame. This new feature
is driven by the new buffer-local variable `window-size-fixed'(1).

ECB offers an option `ecb-fix-window-size' for fixing the sizes of the
special ECB-windows/buffers even after frame-resizing. The fix type (valid
values are `nil', `t', `width' and `height') can either be set on a
layout-basis (means a different value for each layout) or one value can be
set for all layouts. In the latter case there is an additional value `auto'
which choose autom. the senseful fix-type depending on the current
layout-type: For top-layouts the fix-type `height' and for all other
layout-types the fix-type `width'.

Probably the most senseful value is `auto' for all layouts because it makes
less sense to fix the height of the ecb-windows in a left-, right- or
leftright-layout. Same for fixing the width in a top-layout.

Note: With Emacs < 22 there seems to be no distinction between `width',
`height' and `t'. Therefore this option takes no effect (means all
ecb-windows have always unfixed sizes) with Emacs < 22 if
`ecb-compile-window-height' is not `nil'.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) Currently XEmacs does not support this feature therefore
`ecb-fix-window-size' has no effect with XEmacs

6.8.5 Interactively creating new layouts
----------------------------------------

If you want to create your own ECB-layout then you can do this very easy "by
example" with the command `ecb-create-new-layout'.  This command creates a
new empty frame and offers a small set of keys to create the new layout by
splitting windows.  `ecb-create-new-layout' and this couple of keys are your
guide during the layout-creation-process(1).

After calling `ecb-create-new-layout' you will be asked which type of layout
you want to create: "left", "right", "top" or "left-right". Here you specify
where the ECB-tree-windows/buffers should be located in the ECB-frame:

   - left: All ECB-tree-windows are located on the left side

   - right: All ECB-tree-windows are located on the right side

   - top: All ECB-tree-windows are located on the top side

   - left-right: All ECB-tree-windows are located on the left and right side

Depending on the type you choose the window is splitted by the values of the
options `ecb-windows-width' (types "left", "right" and "left-right") or
`ecb-windows-height' (type "top").

Afterwards you will see a frame like follows (here the layout-type is
"left-right"):

                      `---

The big window (here the middle window) will be the edit-area of the new
layout and can not be selected, deleted or splitted during the creation
process. It displays the help-screen for the layout-creation mode. Here all
the available commands are displayed.

The small window(s) (here the left and right windows) can be splitted by you
wherever you want (`C-s'). The left one contains the point.  You must give
every ECB-tree-window you create a type (`C-t') which can be either

   * One of the built-in types

     This can be either "directories", "sources", "methods", "history" or
     "speedbar".

   * Any user-defined type:

     In this case you insert "other" after hitting `C-t' and you will then be
     asked for the name of the user-defined type. You can insert any
     arbitrary type name X. But to get this layout working you have to define
     a function with name `ecb-set-X-buffer' whereas X is the name of the
     user-defined type you have specified during layout-creation.

     This function `ecb-set-X-buffer' must be defined with the macro
     `defecb-window-dedicator' and has to switch to the buffer you want to
     display in this window. This macro automatically ensures that this
     window is dedicated to that buffer.

     Here is an example: Suppose you have inserted as type name "example"
     then you have to define and load a function `ecb-set-example-buffer'
     which could be defined like follows:

        (defecb-window-dedicator ecb-set-example-buffer " *ECB example-buf*"
          (switch-to-buffer (get-buffer-create " *ECB example-buf*")))

     If you forget to define such a function for the user-defined type then
     nevertheless ECB will draw this layout but it will use the
     default-function `ecb-set-default-ecb-buffer' instead.

If you are satisfied with your new layout just hit `C-q'. You will be asked
for a new layout-name (TAB-completion is offered to get a list of all names
already in use) and after inserting a new(!) name the new layout is saved in
the file defined by the option `ecb-create-layout-file'. The new layout is
now available via the option `ecb-layout-name'.

There is no need for you to load the file `ecb-create-layout-file' manually
into your Emacs because it's automatically loaded by ECB!

*Please note*: During the layout-creation process only the commands displayed
in the help-screen are available. ALL other commands are temporally disabled
(even the mouse-commands).

For programming new layouts with emacs-lisp see *Note The layout-engine::.

With the command `ecb-delete-new-layout' you can delete previously created
layouts (TAB-completion is offered for all names of user created layouts).

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) During the creation process you will be asked in the minibuffer for
several options; here you can use TAB-completion and an "empty" RET chooses
always the first option!

6.9 Hiding/Showing the ECB windows
==================================

With `ecb-toggle-ecb-windows', `ecb-hide-ecb-windows' and
`ecb-show-ecb-windows' you can hide/show all the ECB windows without changing
the activation state of ECB and also without deactivating the advices for
`delete-other-windows' and/or `delete-window'. This is most useful if you use
a layout like "top2" (*note Tips and tricks::) or if you want to have maximum
space for editing and you don't need the browsing windows all the time.

The following sequence of hooks is evaluated during showing again the hidden
ECB-windows:
  1. `ecb-show-ecb-windows-before-hook'

  2. `ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook'

  3. <Redrawing the layout to show the hidden ECB-windows>

  4. `ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook'

  5. `ecb-show-ecb-windows-after-hook'

The following sequence of hooks is evaluated during hiding the ECB-windows:
  1. `ecb-hide-ecb-windows-before-hook'

  2. `ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook'

  3. <Hiding the ECB-windows>

  4. `ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook'

  5. `ecb-hide-ecb-windows-after-hook'

If the special ECB-windows are hidden (e.g. by `ecb-toggle-ecb-windows') all
adviced functions behave as their originals. So the frame can be used as if
ECB would not be active but ECB IS still active in the "background" and all
ECB-commands and all ECB-keybindings can be used. Of course some of them
doesn't make much sense but nevertheless they can be called. Toggling the
visibility of the ECB-windows preserves the splitting-state of the edit-area:
If you hide the ECB-windows then the frame will be divided in the same
window-layout the edit-area had before the hiding and if you show the
ECB-windows again the edit-area will be divided into all the edit-windows the
ECB-frame had before the showing.

Therefore it should be enough to hide the ECB-windows to run other
Emacs-applications which have their own window-layout-managing. There should
be no conflicts. But nevertheless the most recommended method for running ECB
and other applications (e.g. xrefactory, Gnus etc.) in the same frame is to
use a window-manager like winring.el or escreen.el (*note Window-managers and
ECB::).

6.10 Maximizing the ECB windows
===============================

6.10.1 How to maximize and minimize special ecb-tree-windows
------------------------------------------------------------

To get a better overlook about the contents of a certain ECB-window every
ECB-window can be "maximized", means all other ECB-windows are deleted so
only the edit-window(s) and this maximized ECB-window are visible (and maybe
a compile-window if active). There are several ways to do this:

   * Via the node-popup-menus of the ECB-windows

   * Via the main "ECB"-menu and here "Display window maximized"

   * Via calling the adviced version of `delete-other-windows'(1) (bound to
     `C-x 1') in one of the ECB windows.

   * Via one of the commands `ecb-maximize-window-directories',
     `ecb-maximize-window-sources', `ecb-maximize-window-methods',
     `ecb-maximize-window-history' or `ecb-maximize-window-speedbar' or the
     bound short-cuts for those commands.

   * Via the new command `ecb-cycle-maximized-ecb-buffers' which cycles
     through all ecb-buffers of current layout by maximizing exactly one of
     the ecb-windows after every cycle-step.

   * Via the option `ecb-maximize-ecb-window-after-selection' and then just
     by selecting an ECB-window. "Deselecting" an ECB-window brings back all
     ECB-windows of current layout.

   * Via the default modeline-mechanisms for deleting other windows. GNU
     Emacs binds `mouse-2' in its modeline to `delete-other-window'. XEmacs
     binds a popup-menu with some window commands to `button-3' in its
     modeline.

     ECB combines the best of both worlds by supporting both of these
     mechanisms for both Xemacs and Emacs: ECB binds a toggle-command to
     `mouse-2' in the modeline of each tree-buffer which maximizes the
     current tree-window if all ECB-windows are visible and displays all
     ECB-windows if current tree-window is maximized. In addition ECB binds a
     popup-menu to `mouse-3' which offers exactly 2 commands: Maximizing
     current tree-window and displaying all ECB-windows.

"Minimizing" such a maximized ECB-window, i.e. bringing back to its original
size and displays all ecb-windows of current layout, can simply be done by
redrawing the layout via the command `ecb-redraw-layout' (bound to `C-c .
lr').

6.10.2 Selecting a node in a maximized ecb-tree-window
------------------------------------------------------

When you select a node (either via mouse or RET) in a maximized tree-window
the default behavior of ECB is the following:

Maximized directories-window: When selecting a directory then first
automatically the maximized directories-window will be "minimized" (i.e. all
ecb-windows of current layout are displayed) if the current layout contains a
sources-buffer and no sources are shown in the directories-window - see
`ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer'.  So the source-files can be
displayed in the sources-window.

Maximized sources- or history-window: When selecting a source-file in one of
these buffers then first automatically the maximized window will be
"minimized" (i.e. all ecb-windows of current layout are displayed) if the
current layout contains a methods-buffer. So the tag-contents of the selected
source-file can be displayed in the methods-window.

For a even smarter behavior ECB offers the option
`ecb-maximize-next-after-maximized-select' which automatically maximizes the
next logical tree-window after a node selection. The definition of "next
logical is": Directories -> sources, sources/history -> methods. But if the
current maximized tree-buffer is also contained in the option
`ecb-tree-do-not-leave-window-after-select' (see also the tree-buffer-command
`ecb-toggle-do-not-leave-window-after-select' which is bound to <C-t> in each
tree-buffer) then ECB does *not* maximize the next logical tree-window but
point stays in the currently maximized tree-buffer so for example the user
can select more than one source-file from the sources-buffer.

6.11 Back- and forward navigation like a browser
================================================

With ECB you can "browse" in your source-files like with a web-browser. This
means ECB stores the current buffer- and window-position relative to the
current tag(1) in the edit-window after

   - selecting a tag in the ECB-methods buffer or

   - selecting a source-file in the ECB-sources/history-buffer.

ECB offers two commands `ecb-nav-goto-next' (`C-c . n') and
`ecb-nav-goto-previous' (`C-c . p') to go forward and backward within this
navigation history-list. These commands are also available via the menu "ECB
-> Navigate".

Aside normal "location-browsing" this is useful for example in a scenario
where the buffer is narrowed to a tag (see `ecb-tag-visit-post-actions'):

  1. You edit a function

  2. Goto another function above the current in the same file

  3. Add a few lines

  4. Call ecb-nav-goto-previous

     Now you will edit at the same place in the function.

6.12 Synchronization of the ECB-windows
=======================================

Per default ECB synchronizes automatically the contents of the
ECB-windows/tree-buffers with the current active edit-window (rsp. the
current buffer of the edit window):

   * ECB-directories:

     This windows is synchronized to display the directory where the
     source-file which is displayed in the current active edit-window is
     located. If the source-path (i.e. an element of the option
     `ecb-source-path') containing this directory is not expanded it will be
     auto. expanded according to the value of the option
     `ecb-auto-expand-directory-tree' (*note ecb-directories::).

   * ECB-sources:

     The ECB-sources-buffer contains after synchronizing all the sources of
     the directory of the "current" source-file displayed in the edit-window.
     The entry of the "current" source-file is highlighted.

   * ECB-methods:

     Contains after synchronizing all the tags of the buffer in the current
     selected edit-window, i.e. all methods, variables etc... depending on
     the major-mode.

   * ECB-history:

     Highlights the entry of the buffer displayed in the current active
     edit-window if this buffer is a source-file.


This feature can be customized with the option `ecb-window-sync':

If active then the synchronization takes place whenever a buffer changes in
an edit window or if another edit-window with another buffer will be
selected, if deactivated then never. But you can also set this option to a
list of major-modes and then the sync. will only be done if the major-mode of
the current buffer does NOT belong to this list.

But in every case the synchronization only takes place if the major-mode of
the current-buffer in the current selected edit-window has a relation to
files or directories. Examples for the former one are all
programming-language-modes like `c++-mode' or `java-mode', `Info-mode' too,
an example for the latter one is `dired-mode'. For all major-modes related to
non-file/directory-buffers like `help-mode', `customize-mode' and others a
synchronization will never be done!

It's recommended to exclude at least `Info-mode' because it makes no sense to
synchronize the ECB-windows after calling the Info help.  Per default also
`dired-mode' is excluded but it can also making sense to synchronize the
ECB-directories/sources windows with the current directory of the
dired-buffer in the edit-window.

If you often need to toggle between autom. synchronization on and off then
customizing the option `ecb-window-sync' is inefficient and therefore ECB
offers the command `ecb-toggle-window-sync'.

*Please note*: With the command `ecb-window-sync' you can do a manual
synchronization if the automatic one is switched off or if you just want to
do this!


File: ecb.info,  Node: Stealthy background tasks,  Next: Interactive ECB commands,  Prev: ECB-window synchronizing,  Up: Usage of ECB

6.13 Stealthy background-tasks of ECB
=====================================

ECB performs some tasks stealthily in the background and also interruptable
by the user because these tasks can be time-consuming and could otherwise
block ECB. Currently the following tasks are performed stealthily and in the
background by ECB:

Prescann directories for emptyness
     Prescann directories and display them as empty or not-empty in the
     directories-buffer. See the documentation of the option
     `ecb-prescan-directories-for-emptyness' for a description.

File is read only
     Check if sourcefile-items of the directories- or sources-buffer are
     read-only or not. See documentation of the option
     `ecb-sources-perform-read-only-check'.

Version-control-state
     Checks the version-control-state of files in directories which are
     managed by a VC-backend. See the option `ecb-vc-enable-support'.


All of these tasks (e.g. checking if a directory is empty or not) perform a
certain action for all directories or sources displayed in the current
visible tree-buffers of ECB. Normally there should be no annoying delay for
the user because each of these tasks will be only performed when Emacs is
idle and will be interrupted immediatelly when a user hits a key or clicks
the mouse but especially for remote-directories one single action (e.g.
checking if a certain directory is empty or checking the VC-state of a
sourcefile in such a remote directory) can be very time-consuming and such a
single action is not interruptable (an interrupt can only occur between the
single-actions for two directories or sources) For a further discussion how
to deal best with remote directories see *Note Remote directories::.!

ECB offers for all stealthy tasks three steps of activation:
   * `t': Switch on this feature.

   * `unless-remote': Switch on this feature but not for remote directories.
     The term "remote" means here directories which are used via tramp,
     ange-ftp or efs. So mounted directories are counted not as remote
     directories here even if such a directory is maybe hosted on a remote
     machine. But normally only directories in a LAN are mounted so there
     should be no performance-problems with such mounted directories.

   * `nil': Switch off this feature completely.

In combination with the option `ecb-stealthy-tasks-delay' these three choices
already allow adapting the stealthy tasks to most needs. But to offer finest
granularity for which directories a certain stealthy task should be switched
on and for which not ECB offers for every stealthy task an additional option
which allows a finer adjustment:

   * Prescanning directories for emptyness:
     `ecb-prescan-directories-exclude-regexps'.

   * Checking the read-only-state of a sourcefile:
     `ecb-read-only-check-exclude-regexps'

   * Checking the VC-state of sourcefiles: `ecb-vc-directory-exclude-regexps'

These options take only effect when the related task is not completely
switched off. If this is the case they allow excluding certain directories
(or the sources of directories) from being processed by a certain stealthy
task.

6.14 Interactive ECB commands
=============================

ECB offers a lot of interactive commands. Some of these commands prompt the
user in the minibuffer if called with a prefix argument.

Example: If `ecb-clear-history' is called with a prefix argument then you
will be prompted in the minibuffer with:

   Clear from history: [all, not-existing-buffers, existing-buffers]

You can choose one of the options enclosed in brackets with TAB-completion;
hitting RET direct after the prompt chooses auto. the first offered option
(in the example above "all").

*Please note*: The following interactive commands of ECB are listed without
the prefix "ecb-" (e.g. the command `ecb-activate' is listed with name
"activate"). This has been done for a better readable command index. *Note
Command Index::.

 -- Command: activate
     Activates ECB and creates the special buffers for the choosen layout.
     For the layout see `ecb-layout-name'. This function always raises the
     ECB-frame if called from another frame. This is the same as calling
     `ecb-minor-mode' with a positive argument.

 -- Command: add-all-buffers-to-history
     Add all current file-buffers to the history-buffer of ECB. Dependend on
     the value of `ecb-history-sort-method' afterwards the history is sorted
     either by name or by extension. If `ecb-history-sort-method' is nil the
     most recently used buffers are on the top of the history and the seldom
     used buffers at the bottom.

 -- Command: analyse-buffer-sync
     Synchronize the analyse buffer with the current buffer and point. This
     means in fact display the current analysis for current point.

 -- Command: change-layout &optional preselect-type
     Select a layout-name from all current available layouts (TAB-completion
     is offered) and change the layout to the selected layout-name. If
     optional argument PRESELECT-TYPE is not nil then you can preselect a
     layout-type \(TAB-completion is offered too) and then you will be asked
     only for layouts of that preselected type. Note: This function works by
     changing the option `ecb-layout-name' but only for current Emacs-session.

 -- Command: clear-history
     Clears the history-buffer.

 -- Command: customize
     Open a customize-buffer for all customize-groups of ECB.

 -- Command: customize-most-important
     Open a customize-buffer for the most important options of ECB.

 -- Command: create-new-layout
     Start process for interactively creating a new ECB-layout (*note
     Creating a new ECB-layout::).

 -- Command: cycle-maximized-ecb-buffers
     Cycles through all ecb-buffers of current layout by maximizing exactly
     one of the ecb-windows after every cycle-step.

 -- Command: cycle-through-compilation-buffers &optional choose-buffer
     Cycle through all compilation buffers currently open and display them
     within the compilation window `ecb-compile-window'. If the currently
     opened buffer within the compilation window is not a compilation buffer,
     we jump to the first compilation buffer. If not we try to loop through
     all compilation buffers. If we hit the end we go back to the beginning.

     If CHOOSE-BUFFER is not `nil' then the user will be prompted for the
     compilation-buffer to switch to.

 -- Command: deactivate
     Deactivates the ECB and kills all ECB buffers and windows.

 -- Command: delete-new-layout
     Select a layout-name for a layout created by `ecb-create-new-layout' and
     delete this layout. This means the layout-definition is removed from the
     file `ecb-create-layout-file' and the layout-function and associated
     aliases are unbound.

 -- Command: display-news-for-upgrade &optional FULL-NEWS
     Display the most important NEWS after an ECB-upgrade. If you call this
     function but no ECB-upgrade has been performed before starting ECB then
     nothing is display unless FULL-NEWS is not nil.

     If FULL-NEWS is not nil then the NEWS-file is displayed in another
     window.

 -- Command: display-upgraded-options
     Display a information-buffer which options have been upgraded or reset.
     Offers two buttons where the user can decide if the upgraded options
     should also being saved by ECB for future settings or if the buffer
     should be killed.

     If saving is possible this command display where the options would be
     saved. It is that file Emacs uses to save customize-settings. This file
     is "computed" from the settings in `custom-file' and `user-init-file'
     (see the documentation of these variables).

     ECB automatically makes a backup-file of that file which will be
     modified by storing the upgraded rsp. renamed ECB-options. This backup
     file gets a unique name by adding a suffix ".before_ecb_<version>" to
     the name of the modified file. If such a file already exists ECB adds a
     unique number to the end of the filename to make the filename unique.
     This is a safety mechanism if something fails during storing the
     upgraded options, so you never lose the contents of your
     customization-file!

 -- Command: download-ecb
     Download ECB from the ECB-website and install it. For this the option
     `ecb-download-url' must be set correct, whereas the default value of
     this option should always be correct.

     If `ecb-download-package-version-type' is set to -1 (means asking for a
     version) then you will be ask in the minibuffer for the version to
     download. Otherwise ECB downloads autom. the latest version available
     for the type specified in `ecb-download-package-version-type'. If no
     newer version than the current one is available no download will be done.

     For details about downloading and what requirements must be satisfied
     see function `ecb-package-download' and option
     `ecb-download-package-version-type'!

     After successful downloading the new ECB will be installed in a
     subdirectory of `ecb-download-install-parent-dir'. After adding this
     subdirectory to `load-path' and restarting Emacs the new ECB version can
     be activated by `ecb-activate'.

     If current running ECB is installed as regular XEmacs-package and not
     with the archive available at the ECB website then this function asks
     for proceeding!

 -- Command: download-semantic
     Download semantic from the semantic-website and install it. For this the
     variable `ecb-cedet-url' must be set correct, whereas the default value
     of this variable should always be correct.

     If `ecb-download-package-version-type' is set to -1 (means asking for a
     version) then you will be ask in the minibuffer for the version to
     download. Otherwise ECB downloads autom. the latest version available
     for the type specified in `ecb-download-package-version-type'. If no
     newer version than the current one is available no download will be done.

     For details about downloading and what requirements must be satisfied
     see function `ecb-package-download' and option
     `ecb-download-package-version-type'!

     After successful downloading the new semantic will be installed in a
     subdirectory of `ecb-download-install-parent-dir'. After adding this new
     subdirectory to `load-path' and restarting Emacs the new semantic
     version is loaded and is used after next start of ECB.

     If current running semantic is installed as regular XEmacs-package and
     not with the archive available at the semantic website then this
     function asks for proceeding!

 -- Command: expand-methods-nodes &optional force-all
     Set the expand level of the nodes in the ECB-methods-buffer.

     This command asks in the minibuffer for an indentation level LEVEL. With
     this LEVEL you can precisely specify which level of nodes should be
     expanded. LEVEL means the indentation-level of the nodes.

     A LEVEL value X means that all nodes with an indentation-level <= X are
     expanded and all other are collapsed. A negative LEVEL value means all
     visible nodes are collapsed.

     Nodes which are not indented have indentation-level 0!

     Which node-types are expanded (rsp. collapsed) by this command depends
     on the options `ecb-methods-nodes-expand-spec' and
     `ecb-methods-nodes-collapse-spec'! With optional argument FORCE-ALL all
     tags will be expanded/collapsed regardless of the values of these
     options.

     Examples:
        - LEVEL = 0 expands only nodes which have no indentation itself.

        - LEVEL = 2 expands nodes which are either not indented or indented
          indented once or twice

        - LEVEL ~ 10 should normally expand all nodes expect there are nodes
          which are indented deeper than 10.

     Note 1: This command switches off auto. expanding of the method-buffer
     if `ecb-expand-methods-switch-off-auto-expand' is not nil. But it can be
     switched on again quickly with `ecb-toggle-auto-expand-tag-tree' or
     `[C-c . a]'.

     Note 2: All this is only valid for file-types parsed by semantic. For
     other file types which are parsed by imenu or etags (see
     `ecb-process-non-semantic-files') FORCE-ALL is always true!

 -- Command: dump-semantic-toplevel
     Dump the current semantic-tags in special buffer and display them.

 -- Command: eshell-current-buffer-sync
     Synchronize the eshell with the directory of current source-buffer.
     This is only done if the eshell is currently visible in the
     compile-window of ECB and if either this function is called
     interactively or `ecb-eshell-synchronize' is not nil.

 -- Command: eshell-recenter
     Recenter the eshell window so that the prompt is at the buffer-end.

 -- Command: expand-directory-nodes
     Set the expand level of the nodes in the ECB-directories-buffer. For
     argument LEVEL see `ecb-expand-methods-nodes'.

     Be aware that for deep structured paths and a lot of source-paths this
     command can last a long time - depending on machine- and
     disk-performance.

 -- Command: goto-window-analyse
     Make the ECB-analyse window the current window.

 -- Command: goto-window-compilation
     Goto the ecb compilation window `ecb-compile-window'.

 -- Command: goto-window-directories
     Make the ECB-directories window the current window. If
     `ecb-use-speedbar-instead-native-tree-buffer' is `dir' then goto to the
     speedbar-window.

 -- Command: goto-window-edit1
     Make the (first) edit-window window the current window.

 -- Command: goto-window-edit2
     Make the second edit-window (if available) window the current window.

 -- Command: goto-window-edit-last
     Make the last selected edit-window window the current window. This is
     the same as if `ecb-mouse-click-destination' is set to `last-point'.

 -- Command: goto-window-history
     Make the ECB-history window the current window.

 -- Command: goto-window-methods
     Make the ECB-methods window the current window. If
     `ecb-use-speedbar-instead-native-tree-buffer' is `method' then goto to
     the speedbar-window.

 -- Command: goto-window-sources
     Make the ECB-sources window the current window. If
     `ecb-use-speedbar-instead-native-tree-buffer' is `source' then goto to
     the speedbar-window.

 -- Command: history-filter
     Apply a filter to the history-buffer to reduce the number of entries.
     So you get a better overlooking. There are three choices:

        - Filter by extension: Just insert the extension you want the
          History-buffer being filtered.  Insert the extension without
          leading dot!

        - Filter by regexp: Insert the filter as regular expression.

        - No filter: This means to display an entry for all currently living
          file-buffers.

 -- Command: jde-display-class-at-point
     Display in the ECB-methods-buffer the contents (methods, attributes
     etc...) of the class which contains the definition of the "thing" under
     point (this can be a variable-name, class-name, method-name,
     attribute-name). This function needs the same requirements to work as
     the method-completion feature of JDEE (see `jde-complete')!. The
     source-file is searched first in `jde-sourcepath', then in
     `jde-global-classpath', then in $CLASSPATH, then in current-directory.

     Works only for classes where the source-code (i.e. the *.java-file) is
     available.

 -- Command: maximize-window-analyse
     Maximize the ECB-analyse-window. I.e. delete all other ECB-windows, so
     only one ECB-window and the edit-window(s) are visible (and maybe a
     compile-window). Works also if the ECB-analyse-window is not visible in
     current layout.

 -- Command: maximize-window-directories
     Maximize the ECB-directories-window, i.e. delete all other ECB-windows,
     so only one ECB-window and the edit-window(s) are visible (and maybe a
     compile-window). Works also if the ECB-directories-window is not visible
     in current layout.

 -- Command: maximize-window-sources
     Maximize the ECB-sources-window, i.e. delete all other ECB-windows, so
     only one ECB-window and the edit-window(s) are visible (and maybe a
     compile-window). Works also if the ECB-sources-window is not visible in
     current layout.

 -- Command: maximize-window-methods
     Maximize the ECB-methods-window, i.e. delete all other ECB-windows, so
     only one ECB-window and the edit-window(s) are visible (and maybe a
     compile-window). Works also if the ECB-methods-window is not visible in
     current layout.

 -- Command: maximize-window-history
     Maximize the ECB-history-window, i.e. delete all other ECB-windows, so
     only one ECB-window and the edit-window(s) are visible (and maybe a
     compile-window). Works also if the ECB-history-window is not visible in
     current layout.

 -- Command: maximize-window-speedbar
     Maximize the ECB-speedbar-window, i.e. delete all other ECB-windows, so
     only one ECB-window and the edit-window(s) are visible (and maybe a
     compile-window). Does nothing if the speedbar-window is not visible
     within the ECB-frame.

 -- Command: methods-filter
     Apply a filter to the Methods-buffer to reduce the number of entries.
     So you get a better overlooking. There are six choices:

        * Filter by protection: Just insert the protection you want the
          Methods-buffer being filtered: private, protected or public!

        * Filter by regexp: Insert the filter as regular expression.

        * Filter by tag-class: You can filter by the tag-classes of current
          major-mode. The available tag-classes come from the variable
          `semantic--symbol->name-assoc-list'. The are normally methods,
          variables etc.

        * Filter by current type: In languages which have types like Java or
          C++ this filter displays only the current type and all its members
          (e.g. attributes and methods). If ECB can not identify the current
          type in the source-buffer or in the methods-window then nothing
          will be done.

        * Filter by a filter-function: Such a function gets two arguments: a
          tag and the source-buffer of this tag. If the tag should be
          displayed (i.e. not being filtered out) then the function has to
          return not nil otherwise nil.

        * No special filter: This means to display all tags specified with
          the option `ecb-show-tokens'. If currently some of the above
          filters are applied they will be all removed.

        * Delete the last added: This removes only the topmost filter-layer,
          means that filter added last.

     The protection-, current-type- and the tag-class-filter are only
     available for semantic-supported sources.

     Be aware that the tag-list specified by the option `ecb-show-tags' is
     the basis of all filters, i.e. tags which are excluded by that option
     will never be shown regardless of the filter type here!

     All tags which match the applied filter(s) will be displayed in the
     Methods-buffer.

     If called with a prefix-argument or when optional arg INVERSE is not nil
     then an inverse filter is applied to the Methods-buffer, i.e. all tags
     which do NOT match the choosen filter will be displayed in the
     Methods-buffer!

     Per default the choosen filter will be applied on top of already
     existing filters. This means that filters applied before are combined
     with the new filter. This behavior can changed via the option
     `ecb-methods-filter-replace-existing'. But regardless of the setting in
     `ecb-methods-filter-replace-existing' applying one of the not-inverse
     filters protection, tag-class or current-type always replaces exactly
     already existing filters of that type. On the other hand applying more
     than one inverse tag-class- or protection-filter can make sense.

     Such a filter is only applied to the current source-buffer, i.e. each
     source-buffer can have its own tag-filters.

     The current active filter will be displayed in the modeline of the
     Methods-buffer [regexp, prot (= protection), tag-class, function (=
     filter-function)]. If an inverse filter has been applied then this is
     signalized by a preceding caret ^. If currently more than 1 filter is
     applied then always the top-most filter is displayed in the modeline but
     the fact of more than 1 filter is visualized by the number of the
     filters - included in parens. You can see all currently applied filters
     by moving the mouse over the filter-string in modeline of the
     Methods-buffer: They will displayed as help-echo.

     See the option `ecb-default-tag-filter' if you search for automatically
     applied default-tag-filters.

 -- Command: methods-filter-current-type
     Display in the Methods-buffer only the current type and its members.
     For further details see `ecb-methods-filter'.

 -- Command: methods-filter-delete-last
     Remove the most recent filter from the Methods-buffer. For further
     details see `ecb-methods-filter'.

 -- Command: methods-filter-function &optional inverse
     Filter the methods-buffer by a function. If INVERSE is not nil (called
     with a prefix arg) then an inverse filter is applied. For further
     details see `ecb-methods-filter'.

 -- Command: methods-filter-nofilter
     Remove any filter from the Methods-buffer. For further details see
     `ecb-methods-filter'.

 -- Command: methods-filter-protection &optional inverse
     Filter the methods-buffer by protection. If INVERSE is not nil (called
     with a prefix arg) then an inverse filter is applied. For further
     details see `ecb-methods-filter'.

 -- Command: methods-filter-regexp &optional inverse
     Filter the methods-buffer by a regexp. If INVERSE is not nil (called
     with a prefix arg) then an inverse filter is applied. For further
     details see `ecb-methods-filter'.

 -- Command: methods-filter-tagclass &optional inverse
     Filter the methods-buffer by tag-class. If INVERSE is not nil (called
     with a prefix arg) then an inverse filter is applied. For further
     details see `ecb-methods-filter'.

 -- Command: minor-mode &optional arg
     Toggle ECB minor mode. With prefix argument ARG, turn on if positive,
     otherwise off. Return non-`nil' if the minor mode is enabled.

 -- Command: nav-goto-previous
     Go backward in the navigation history-list, see *Note Back/forward
     navigation::.

 -- Command: nav-goto-next
     Go forward in the navigation history-list, see *Note Back/forward
     navigation::.

 -- Command: rebuild-methods-buffer
     Updates the methods buffer with the current buffer after deleting the
     complete previous parser-information, means no semantic-cache is used!
     Point must stay in an edit-window otherwise nothing is done. This method
     is merely needed for semantic parsed buffers if semantic parses not the
     whole buffer because it reaches a not parse-able code or for buffers not
     supported by semantic but by imenu or etags.

     Examples when a call to this function can be necessary:

        * If an Elisp-file is parsed which contains in the middle a defun X
          where the closing ) is missing then semantic parses only until this
          defun X is reached and you will get an incomplete ECB-method buffer.
          In such a case you must complete the defun X and then call this
          function to completely reparse the Elisp-file and rebuild the ECB
          method buffer!

        * For not semantic supported buffers which can be parsed by imenu or
          etags (see `ecb-process-non-semantic-files') because for these
          buffers there is no built-in auto-rebuild mechanism. For these
          buffers this command calls
          `ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer-for-non-semantic'.

     For non-semantic-sources supported by etags the option
     `ecb-auto-save-before-etags-methods-rebuild' is checked before
     rescanning the source-buffer and rebuilding the methods-buffer.

     If point is in one of the ecb-windows or in the compile-window then this
     command rebuids the methods-buffer with the contents of the
     source-buffer the last selected edit-window.

 -- Command: redraw-layout &optional ARG
     Redraw the ECB screen.

     Do not call this command from elisp-program but only interactively!

     Called without a prefix-argument the state of the ECB-frame-layout will
     preserved. This means:

        - The state of compile-window (hidden or visible) will be preserved
          but if visible then the height will be as specified in
          `ecb-compile-window-height'.

        - The state of the ECB-windows will be preserved (hidden or visible)
          but if visible then the sizes will be as specified in the layout
          (and with the options `ecb-windows-width' and `ecb-windows-height')
          or as stored with `ecb-store-window-sizes'.

     If called with ONE prefix-argument (`[C-u]') then the layout will be
     drawn with all ECB-windows and also with a visible compile-window (when
     `ecb-compile-window-height' is not nil). The splitting-state of the
     edit-area will be preserved.

     If called with TWO prefix-arguments (i.e. hitting `[C-u]' twice:
     (`[C-u]' `[C-u]') then an emergency-redraw will be performed.  This
     means the same as if called with one prefix-argument (s.a.) but the
     splitting-state of the edit-area will NOT be preserved but all
     edit-windows besides the current one will be deleted. Use this only if
     there are some anomalies after standard redraws!

     If the variable `ecb-redraw-layout-quickly' is not nil then the redraw
     is done by the `ecb-redraw-layout-quickly' function, otherwise by
     `ecb-redraw-layout-full'.

     Please not: It's strongly recommended to use the quick redraw only if
     you have really slow machines where a full redraw takes several seconds
     because the quick redraw is not really safe and has some annoying
     drawbacks! On normal machines the full redraw should be done in << 1s so
     there should be no need for the quick version!

 -- Command: restore-default-window-sizes
     Resets the sizes of the ECB windows to their default values.

 -- Command: restore-window-sizes
     Sets the sizes of the ECB windows to their stored values. See option
     `ecb-layout-window-sizes' and command `ecb-store-window-sizes'.

 -- Command: select-ecb-frame
     Selects the `ecb-frame' if ECB is activated - otherwise reports an error.

 -- Command: show-help &optional format
     Shows the online help of ECB either in Info or in HTML format depending
     on the value of `ecb-show-help-format'. If called with prefix argument,
     i.e. if FORMAT is not nil then the user is prompted to choose the format
     of the help (Info or HTML). If an error about not finding the needed
     help-file occurs please take a look at the options
     `ecb-help-info-start-file' and `ecb-help-html-start-file'!

     Note: If you got ECB as a standard XEmacs-package maybe the
     HTML-online-documentation is not included.

 -- Command: show-layout-help
     Select a name of a layout and shows the documentation of the associated
     layout-function. At least for the built-in layouts the documentation
     contains a picture of the outline of the chosen layout.

 -- Command: show-tip-of-the-day
     Show tip of the day if `ecb-tip-of-the-day' is not nil or if called
     interactively.

 -- Command: sources-filter
     Apply a filter to the sources-buffer to reduce the number of entries.
     So you get a better overlooking. There are three choices:

        - Filter by extension: Just insert the extension you want the
          Sources-buffer being filtered.  Insert the extension without
          leading dot!

        - Filter by regexp: Insert the filter as regular expression.

        - No filter: This means to display an entry for every file in the
          current selected directory (all except these filter already
          filtered out by `ecb-source-file-regexps' and
          `ecb-sources-exclude-cvsignore').

     Such a filter is only applied to the current selected directory, i.e.
     each directory has its own filtered sources-buffer.

 -- Command: store-window-sizes &optional FIX
     Stores the sizes of the ECB windows for the current layout. The size of
     the ECB windows will be set to their stored values when
     `ecb-redraw-layout' or `ecb-restore-window-sizes' is called.  To reset
     the window sizes to their default values call
     `ecb-restore-default-window-sizes'. Please read also the documentation
     of `ecb-layout-window-sizes'!

     The windows sizes are stored per default as fractions of current
     frame-width and -height of the ecb-frame, so the stored values will
     "work" for other frame sizes too. If a permanent compile-window is
     visible then ECB will tell you that window-sizes should be stored with
     hidden compile-window and ask you if you want proceed; if you proceed
     then the window-heights will be stored as fractions of current
     (frame-height minus current visible compile-window-height) so you should
     ensure that the current compile-window has its standard-height as
     specified in `ecb-compile-window-height'!. If FIX is not nil (means
     called with a prefix argument) then always the fixed values of current
     width and height are stored!

 -- Command: submit-problem-report
     Submit a problem report for the ECB to the ECB mailing-list. This
     command generates in the edit-window a problem-report which contains
     already the current values of all ECB options, the current
     backtrace-buffer if there is any and the current message-buffer. You
     will be asked for a problem-report subject and then you must insert a
     description of the problem. Please describe the problem as detailed as
     possible!

 -- Command: toggle-auto-expand-tag-tree &optional arg
     Toggle auto expanding of the ECB-methods-buffer. With prefix argument
     ARG, make switch on if positive, otherwise switch off. If the effect is
     that auto-expanding is switched off then the current value of
     `ecb-auto-expand-tag-tree' is saved so it can be used for the next
     switch on by this command.

 -- Command: toggle-compile-window &optional arg
     Toggle the visibility of the compile-window of ECB. With prefix argument
     ARG, make visible if positive, otherwise invisible. The height of the
     compile-window is always the current value of
     `ecb-compile-window-height'! If called and `ecb-compile-window-height'
     is nil then ECB asks for the height of the compile-window, sets this
     height as new value of `ecb-compile-window-height' and displays the
     compile-window (so if you have called this command by mistake and you do
     not want a compile-window you have to quit with <C-g>).

 -- Command: toggle-compile-window-height &optional arg
     Toggle whether the `ecb-compile-window' is enlarged or not. If ARG > 0
     then shrink or enlarge the the compile-window according to the value of
     `ecb-enlarged-compilation-window-max-height'. But never shrink below the
     value of `ecb-compile-window-height'. If ARG <= 0 then shrink
     `ecb-compile-window' to `ecb-compile-window-height' and if ARG is nil
     then toggle the enlarge-state.

 -- Command: toggle-ecb-windows &optional arg
     Toggle visibility of the ECB-windows. With prefix argument ARG, make
     visible if positive, otherwise invisible. This has nothing to do with
     (de)activating ECB but only affects the visibility of the ECB windows.
     ECB minor mode remains active!

 -- Command: toggle-layout &optional last-one
     Toggles between the layouts defined in `ecb-toggle-layout-sequence' (See
     also option `ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer'). Note: This
     function works by changing the options `ecb-layout-name' but only for
     current Emacs-session.

     If optional argument LAST-ONE is not nil (e.g. called with a prefix-arg)
     then always the last selected layout was choosen regardless of the
     setting in `ecb-toggle-layout-sequence'. The last selected layout is
     always that layout which was current direct before the most recent
     layout-switch. So now a user can switch to another layout via
     `ecb-change-layout' and always come back to his previous layout via
     `[C-u]' `ecb-toggle-layout'.

 -- Command: toggle-scroll-other-window-scrolls-compile &optional ARG
     Toggle the state of `ecb-scroll-other-window-scrolls-compile-window'.
     With prefix argument ARG, set it to `t', otherwise to `nil'. For all
     details about the scroll-behavior of `scroll-other-window' see the
     advice documentation of `other-window-for-scrolling'.

 -- Command: toggle-window-sync &optional arg
     Toggle auto synchronizing of the ECB-windows. With prefix argument ARG,
     switch on if positive, otherwise switch off. If the effect is that
     auto-synchronizing is switched off then the current value of the option
     `ecb-window-sync' is saved so it can be used for the next switch on by
     this command. See also the option `ecb-window-sync'.

 -- Command: update-directories-buffer
     Updates the ECB directories buffer.

 -- Command: upgrade-options
     Check for all ECB-options if their current value is compatible to the
     defined type. If not upgrade it to the new type or reset it to the
     default-value of current ECB. Try also to upgrade renamed options.
     Displays all upgraded or reset options with their old (before the
     upgrade/reset) and new values.

 -- Command: window-sync
     Synchronizes all special ECB-buffers with current buffer.

     Depending on the contents of current buffer this command performs
     different synchronizing tasks but only if ECB is active and point stays
     in an edit-window.

        * If current buffer is a file-buffer then all special
          ECB-tree-buffers are synchronized with current buffer.

        * If current buffer is a dired-buffer then the directory- and the
          sources-tree-buffer are synchronized if visible

     In addition to this the hooks in `ecb-current-buffer-sync-hook' run.

Most of these functions are also available via the menu "ECB" and also via
the ECB key-map with prefix `C-c .' (see `ecb-minor-mode' for a complete list
of the keybindings).

7.1 General aspects for customizing ECB
=======================================

This chapter contains all important informations you should know about
customizing ECB. The first section gives an answer to the question "`setq' or
`customize'" and the second section describes what to do when you have to
customize ECB for a lot of people.

* Menu:

* setq or customize::           Should i use setq or customize?

File: ecb.info,  Node: setq or customize,  Next: Site-wide customizing,  Prev: General aspects,  Up: General aspects

7.1.1 Setq or customize - what should i use?
--------------------------------------------

The best way to customize all the options of ECB is via the customize-feature
of (X)Emacs, i.e. means calling the commands `customize-option' or
`customize-group' etc. This is also the strongly recommended way!

But of course you can also use `setq' or some Elisp-code to change the values
of many but not all of the options. The values of the following options *MUST
NOT* be changed via `setq' or Elisp-code but only with the customize-feature!

   - `ecb-bucket-node-display'

   - `ecb-compile-window-height'

   - `ecb-compile-window-temporally-enlarge'

   - `ecb-compile-window-width'

   - `ecb-exclude-parents-regexp'

   - `ecb-fix-window-size'

   - `ecb-font-lock-tags'

   - `ecb-highlight-tag-with-point-delay'

   - `ecb-key-map'

   - `ecb-layout-name'

   - `ecb-layout-window-sizes'

   - `ecb-mode-line-data'

   - `ecb-mode-line-display-window-number'

   - `ecb-mode-line-prefixes'

   - `ecb-show-node-info-in-minibuffer'

   - `ecb-show-tags'

   - `ecb-source-path'

   - `ecb-toggle-layout-sequence'

   - `ecb-tag-display-function'

   - `ecb-tree-do-not-leave-window-after-select'

   - `ecb-type-tag-display'

   - `ecb-type-tag-expansion'

   - `ecb-use-speedbar-instead-native-tree-buffer'

   - `ecb-window-sync-delay'

   - `ecb-windows-height'

   - `ecb-windows-width'


File: ecb.info,  Node: Site-wide customizing,  Prev: setq or customize,  Up: General aspects

7.1.2 Site-wide customizing of ECB
----------------------------------

If you are the administrator for an Emacs-site, means you are responsible for
the basic customization of a lot of Emacs users, then you maybe need a way to
customize Emacs and ECB without changing everyones `.emacs'-file and normally
you will do this with the file `site-start.el'. You can customize all options
of ECB in a central `site-start.el' (even the options mentioned above!) but
you *MUST NOT* do this via `setq' but you have to use a mechanism like the
following(1)!

This section describes two methods how to pre-customize ECB site-wide.  The
elisp-code contained in the following two subsections has to be copied to the
file `site-start.el' before it can be used.

But ensure for both methods that you customize the options with the correct
lisp format. Read carefully the docstrings of the options you want to
customize from within Elisp-code!

7.1.2.1 Storing all option-settings in the users custom-file
............................................................

The mechanism described here defines all site-wide-settings in a file
`site-lisp.el' but stores the values in the users `custom-file' which is
probably `.emacs'!

First two helper functions are needed, namely `customize-option-get-value' and
`customize-save-variable-save' whereas the latter one sets the value for an
option via the customize-mechanism (and is therefore allowed for the
setq-forbidden options!) but only if the option has no saved value until now
(i.e. the user has not saved this option for future sessions until now)

   (defun customize-option-get-value (option type)
     "Return the value of a customizable option OPTION with TYPE, where TYPE
   can either be 'standard-value \(the default-value of the defcustom) or
   'saved-value \(the value stored persistent by the user via customize)."
     (let ((val (car (get option type))))
       (cond ((not (listp val)) val)
             ((equal 'quote (car val)) (car (cdr val)))
             (t (car val)))))

   (defun customize-save-variable-save (option value &optional override)
     "Calls `customize-save-variable' with OPTION and VALUE if OPTION is a
   custom-type and if OPTION has no saved-value until now.
   If OVERRIDE is a function or lambda-form then it is called with two arguments:
   - OLD-SAVED-VAL: The saved value of OPTION
   - NEW-VALUE: see argument VALUE.
   OVERRIDE is only called if OPTION has already a saved-value. If OVERIDE
   returns not nil then `customize-save-variable' is called for OPTION with VALUE
   even if OPTION has no saved-value until now."
     (and (get option 'custom-type)
          (or (not (get option 'saved-value))
              (and (functionp override)
                   (funcall override
                            (customize-option-get-value option 'saved-value)
                            value)))
          (progn
            (message "Overriding saved value for option %s with %s" option value)
            (customize-save-variable option value))))

With `customize-save-variable-save' all ECB-options can be site-wide
pre-customized like follows:

   (customize-save-variable-save 'ecb-show-tags
                                 '((include collapsed nil)
                                   (parent collapsed nil)
                                   (type flattened nil)
                                   (variable collapsed name)
                                   (function flattened name)
                                   (rule flattened name)
                                   (section flattened nil)
                                   (def collapsed name)
                                   (t collapsed name)))
   (customize-save-variable-save 'ecb-font-lock-tags t)
   ;; add here more options of ECB it you want

7.1.2.2 Using a special setq for site-wide settings
...................................................

The mechanism above saves the pre-customized values always in the users
`custom-file' (probably `.emacs'). If this is not preferred, then you can use
the following mechanism but of course the offered `setq-save' is only allowed
for options which are not setq-forbidden (*note setq or customize::).

The mechanism below does not change the users `custom-file'. This mechanism
is needed especially if ECB should be autoloaded and all site-wide settings
should first loaded when ECB is activated by the user. This can be achieved
for example via(2):

   (require 'ecb-autoloads))
   (eval-after-load "ecb"
     '(require 'site-ecb))

In such a situation the whole `custom-file' of a user is mostly loaded
*before* ECB is activated and therefore before the site-wide-settings are
loaded. So the users own customizations are loaded before the site-wide ones.

The `setq-save'-mechanism described below prevents the users own
customisations contained in his `custom-file' from being overridden by the
site-wide setq-settings. If `setq' would be used for the site-wide settings
then in an autoload-situation the site-wide settings would override the
users-settings and this should not be done!

First two helper-macros are needed:

   (defmacro custom-saved-p (option)
     "Return only not nil if OPTION is a defcustom-option and has a
   saved value. Option is a variable and is literal \(not evaluated)."
     `(and (get (quote ,option) 'custom-type)
           (get (quote ,option) 'saved-value)))

   (defmacro setq-save (option value)
     "Sets OPTION to VALUE if and only if OPTION is not already saved
   by customize. Option is a variable and is literal \(not evaluated)."
     `(and (not (custom-saved-p ,option))
           (set (quote ,option) ,value)))

With `setq-save' all "not-setq-forbidden"-ECB-options can be site-wide
pre-customized like follows:

   (setq-save ecb-tree-indent 4)
   (setq-save ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before t)
   (setq-save ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons 'mouse-1--mouse-2)

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) At least for the options for which `setq' is explicitly forbidden, but it
is recommended to use always such a mechanism

(2) The file `site-ecb.el' contains all site-wide settings for ECB

7.2 The most important options of ECB
=====================================

Here are the most important options (it is recommended to check at least the
following options before working with ECB). You can customize them via the
customize-group "ecb-most-important" or via the command
`ecb-customize-most-important'.

`ecb-source-path'
     Where ECB can find your sources. You must set this option!

`ecb-show-help-format'
     Should the online help of ECB be displayed in the standard Info format
     or in HTML format in a web-browser.

`ecb-auto-activate'

`ecb-major-modes-show-or-hide'
     Auto. activation of ECB after start (*note Automatic activation::) or
     major-mode-based showing or hiding the ecb-windows.

`ecb-winman-escreen-number'
`ecb-winman-winring-name'
     Support of several window-managers (*note Window-managers and ECB::).

`ecb-key-map'
     All ECB-keybindings incl. a common prefix-key (*note Using the
     keyboard::).

`ecb-new-ecb-frame'
     Should ECB create a new frame at activation time.

`ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons'
`ecb-mouse-click-destination'
     Define how to use the mouse (*note Using the mouse::).

`ecb-tree-buffer-style'
`ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before'
`ecb-tree-indent'
`ecb-truncate-lines'
     The look&feel of the trees in the tree-buffers. The former option
     defines the general style of the tree-buffers and the latter ones allow
     to customize the ascii-style tree-buffers (maybe you like a value of 4
     for the latter one if you display the expand-symbol before (*note
     Tree-buffer styles::).

`ecb-source-file-regexps'
     Which files will (not) be shown in ECB.

`ecb-show-node-info-in-minibuffer'
     When and which node-info should be displayed in the minibuffer?

`ecb-layout-name'
`ecb-compile-window-height'
`ecb-compile-window-width'
`ecb-other-window-behavior'
     The ECB layout, means which windows you want to be displayed in the
     ECB-frame and also the location of these windows (*note Changing the
     ECB-layout::).

`ecb-compilation-buffer-names'
     Which buffers should be treaten as "compilation-buffers" and therefore
     displayed in the compile-window of ECB - if there is any.

`ecb-tag-display-function'
`ecb-type-tag-display'
`ecb-type-tag-expansion'
`ecb-show-tags'
     How to display the entries in the ECB-method window for semantic
     supported sources (*note Customizing the display::). These options take
     only effect for semantic-sources (*note Definition of semantic- and
     non-semantic-sources::).

`ecb-process-non-semantic-files'
     Displaying file-contents for not by semantic supported files too, e.g.
     for LaTeX- and perl-sources (*note Non-semantic sources::).

But to make ECB working best for you it is also recommended to have a look at

7.3 All customizable options of ECB
===================================

All customization of ECB is divided into the following "customize groups".
You can highly customize all the ECB behavior/layout so just go to these
groups and you will see all well documented ECB-options.

*Please note*: All options in the following subsections are listed without
the prefix "ecb-" (e.g. the option `ecb-layout-name' is listed with name
"layout-name"). This has been done for a better readable option index. *Note
Option Index::.

7.3.1 Group ecb-general
-----------------------

This group contains general settings for the Emacs code browser:

 -- User Option: activate-before-layout-draw-hook
     Normal hook run at the end of activating the ecb-package by running
     `ecb-activate'. This hooks are run after all the internal setup process
     but directly before(!) drawing the layout specified in `ecb-layout'
     (means before dividing the frame into several windows).

     A senseful using of this hook can be maximizing the Emacs-frame for
     example, because this should be done before the layout is drawn because
     ECB computes the size of the ECB-windows with the current frame size! If
     you need a hook-option for the real end of the activating process (i.e.
     after the layout-drawing) look at `ecb-activate-hook'.

     IMPORTANT: The difference between this hook and
     `ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook' is that the latter one is evaluated
     always before the layout is redrawn (for example after calling
     `ecb-redraw-layout') whereas the former one (this hook) is only
     evaluated exactly once during the activation-process of ECB.  So during
     the activation process there is the following sequence of hooks:
       1. `ecb-activate-before-layout-draw-hook' \(this one)

       2. `ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook'

       3. <Drawing the layout>

       4. `ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook'

       5. `ecb-activate-hook'

 -- User Option: activate-hook
     Hook run at the end of activating ECB by `ecb-activate'. This hooks are
     run at the real end of the activating process, means after the layout
     has been drawn!. If you need hooks which are run direct before the
     layout-drawing look at `ecb-activate-before-layout-draw-hook'.

 -- User Option: activation-selects-ecb-frame-if-already-active
     Trying to activate an already activated ECB selects the ECB-frame. If t
     then the ECB-frame is selected, if nil then it is not. If 'ask then ECB
     asks if the ECB-frame should be selected if the current-frame is not the
     `ecb-frame'.

 -- User Option: auto-activate
     Automatically startup ECB when Emacs starts up. This should only be true
     if you always want to run `ecb-activate'.

 -- User Option: auto-compatibility-check
     Check at ECB-startup if all ECB-options have correct values. If not nil
     then all ECB-options are checked if their current value have the correct
     type. It the type is incorrect the option is either auto.  upgraded to
     the new type or reset to the default-value of current ECB if no upgrade
     is possible. This feature can also upgrade options which are renamed in
     current ECB and try to transform the old-value to the new named option.
     After startup all upgraded or reset options are displayed with their old
     (before upgrade/reset) and new values. See also the commands
     `ecb-upgrade-options' and `ecb-display-upgraded-options'. If this option
     is off then the user can perform the check and reset manually with
     `ecb-upgrade-options'.  *Note Auto. option-upgrading::.

 -- User Option: before-activate-hook
     Normal hook run at the beginning of activating the ecb-package by
     running `ecb-activate'. These hooks run before any other tasks of the
     activating process are performed. If any of these hooks returns nil then
     ECB will not be activated!

     This can be used to check some conditions and then only start ECB if all
     conditions are true. For example a function could be added which returns
     only nil if Gnus is running. Then calling `ecb-activate' or
     `ecb-minor-mode' will only start ECB if Gnus is not already running.

 -- User Option: before-deactivate-hook
     Normal hook run at the beginning of deactivating ECB by running
     `ecb-deactivate'. These hooks run before any other tasks of the
     deactivating process are performed. If any of these hooks returns nil
     then ECB will not be deactivated! See also `ecb-before-activate-hook'.

 -- User Option: bucket-node-display
     How ECB displays bucket-nodes in a ECB tree-buffer. Bucket-nodes have
     only one job: Nodes with similar properties will be dropped into one
     bucket for such a common property and all these nodes will be added as
     children to the bucket-node. Besides being expandable and collapsable a
     bucket-node has no senseful action assigned. Examples for bucket-nodes
     are "[+] Variables, "[+] Dependencies" etc. in the Methods-buffer or
     buckets which combine filenames with same extension under a bucket-node
     with name this extension.

     This option defines how bucket-node should be displayed. The name of the
     bucket-node is computed by ECB but you can define a prefix, a suffix and
     a special face for the bucket-node

     The default are empty prefix/suffix-strings and `ecb-bucket-node-face'.
     But an alternative can be for example '("[" "]" nil) which means no
     special face and a display like "[+] [<bucket-name>]".

 -- User Option: clear-caches-before-activate
     Clear all ECB internal caches before startup. If t then ECB clears all
     its internal caches before starting up. Caches are used for files- and
     subdirs (see `ecb-cache-directory-contents' and
     `ecb-cache-directory-contents-not') for semantic-tags and for the
     history-filter.

     This caches are completely clean at load-time of the ECB-library!

     Default is nil, because is makes sense not to clear these caches at
     start-time because ECB is often deacticated temporally especially in
     combination with window-managers like escreen.el. In these situations
     the internal state of ECB should be preserved for next activation.

 -- User Option: current-buffer-sync-hook
     Normal hook run at the end of `ecb-current-buffer-sync'.

     See documentation of `ecb-current-buffer-sync' for conditions when
     synchronization takes place and so in turn these hooks are evaluated.

     Precondition for such a hook: Current buffer is the buffer of the
     current selected edit-window.

     Postcondition for such a hook: Point must stay in the same edit-window
     as before evaluating the hook.

     Important note: If `ecb-window-sync' is not nil
     `ecb-current-buffer-sync' is running either every time Emacs is idle or
     even after every command (see `ecb-window-sync-delay').  So these hooks
     can be really called very often! Therefore each function of this hook
     should/must check in an efficient way at beginning if its task have to
     be really performed and then do them only if really necessary! Otherwise
     performance of Emacs could slow down dramatically!

     It is strongly recommended that each function added to this hook uses
     the macro `ecb-do-if-buffer-visible-in-ecb-frame' at beginning!  See
     `ecb-speedbar-current-buffer-sync' and `ecb-eshell-current-buffer-sync'
     for examples how to use this macro!

 -- User Option: deactivate-hook
     Normal hook run at the end of deactivating (but before the ecb-layout is
     cleared!) ECB by running `ecb-deactivate'.

 -- User Option: debug-mode
     If not nil ECB displays debug-information in the Messages-buffer. This
     is done for some critical situations concerning semantic-tags and their
     overlays (or extends for XEmacs). Normally you should not need this
     switched on! But if you get errors like "destroyed extend" for XEmacs or
     "wrong-argument-type" concerning overlays for GNU Emacs then you should
     switch on this option and submitting a bug-report to the
     ecb-mailing-list (`ecb-submit-problem-report') after getting the error
     again!

 -- User Option: grep-function
     Function used for performing a grep. The popup-menu of the tree-buffers
     "Directories", "Sources" and "History" offer to grep the "current"
     directory:
        - Directory-buffer: The grep is performed in the current
          popup-directory after clicking the right mouse-button onto a node.

        - Sources-buffer: The grep is performed in the current selected
          directory.

        - History-buffer: The grep is performed in the directory of the
          current popup-source after clicking the right mouse-button onto a
          node.

 -- User Option: grep-find-function
     Function used for performing a recursive grep. For more Details see
     option `ecb-grep-function' and replace "grep" with "recursive grep".

 -- User Option: key-map
     Specifies all keybindings for the ECB minor-mode key-map. The value is a
     cons-cell where the car is a common-prefix key for all the keybindings.
     The cdr is a list of keybindings each of them a list again. A
     key-binding has the following form:

        '(<common-prefix-flag> <keysequence> <function>) where

    `<common-prefix-flag>'
          If t then the common-prefix-key defined as car of the value (see
          above) is used.

    `<keysequence>'
          If the common prefix-key is used then the final key-binding is the
          concatenation of the common-prefix-key (see above) and this
          keysequence.

    `<function>:'
          The function to bind to the key. This can also be a
          lambda-expression .

     It is highly recommended to use one of the standard keys C-c or C-x as
     first key of your common-prefix-key!

     You MUST change this option via customize to take effect!

     All keysequences must be inserted as a string and must follow the syntax
     needed by `read-kbd-macro' or `kbd'. This means you can insert the key
     in the same manner `C-h k' displays keysequences.  Here is the summary
     of the syntax:

     Text is divided into "words" separated by whitespace. Except for the
     words described below, the characters of each word go directly as
     characters of the keysequence. The whitespace that separates words is
     ignored. Whitespace in the macro must be written explicitly, as in `C-c
     SPC'.

        * The special words RET, SPC, TAB, DEL, LFD, ESC, and NUL represent
          special control characters. The words must be written in uppercase.

        * A word in angle brackets, e.g., <return>, <down>, <left> or <f1>,
          represents a function key. (Note that in the standard configuration,
          the function key <return> and the control key RET are synonymous.).
          You can use angle brackets on the words RET, SPC, etc., but they are
          not required there.

        * Keys can be written by their ASCII code, using a backslash followed
          by up to six octal digits. This is the only way to represent keys
          with codes above ÿ.

        * One or more prefixes M- (meta), C- (control), S- (shift), A- (alt),
          H- (hyper), and s- (super) may precede a character or key notation.
          For function keys, the prefixes may go inside or outside of the
          brackets: C-<down> = <C-down>. The prefixes may be written in any
          order: M-C-x = C-M-x. Prefixes are not allowed on multi-key words,
          e.g., C-abc, except that the Meta prefix is allowed on a sequence
          of digits and optional minus sign: M-123 = M- M-1 M-2 M-3.

        * The `^' notation for control characters also works: ^M = C-m.

 -- User Option: major-modes-show-or-hide
     List of major-modes which show or hide the ecb-windows. The value is a
     cons-cell where the car contains all major-mode-symbols which should
     show the special ecb-windows and the cdr contains all major-mode-symbols
     which should hide the special ecb-windows. If the symbol of a major-mode
     is neither contained in the car-"show-list" nor in the cdr-"hide-list"
     then the visibility-state of the ecb-windows does not change.

 -- User Option: minor-mode-text
     String to display in the mode line when ECB minor mode is active.  (When
     the string is not empty, make sure that it has a leading space.)

     Because for ECB it is quite obvious if it is active or not when the
     ECB-windows are visible this text is only display in the modeline if the
     ECB-windows are hidden.

 -- User Option: mouse-click-destination
     Destination of a mouse-button click. Defines in which edit-window (if
     splitted) ECB does the "right" action (opening a source, jumping to a
     method/variable etc.) after clicking with the primary mouse-button (see
     `ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons') onto a node. There are two
     possible choices:

        - `left-top': Does the "right" action always in the left/topmost
          edit-window.

        - `last-point': Does the "right" action always in that edit-window
          which had the point before.
     This is if the user has clicked either with the primary mouse-button or
     has activated a popup-menu in the tree-buffer.

     If the edit-area is not splitted this setting doesn't matter.

     A click with the secondary mouse-button (see again
     `ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons' does the "right" action always in
     another edit-window related to the setting in this option: If there are
     two edit-windows then the "other" edit-window is used and for more than
     2 edit-windows the "next" edit-window is used (whereas the next
     edit-window of the last edit-window is the first edit-window).

     Note: If the tree-buffers are used with the keyboard instead with the
     mouse then this option takes effect too because `RET' is interpreted as
     primary mouse-button and `C-RET' as secondary mouse-button!

 -- User Option: run-ediff-in-ecb-frame
     Run ediff-sessions in the same frame as ECB is running.  If not nil then
     ECB ensures that ediff runs in the same frame as ECB and ECB restores
     exactly the "before-ediff"-window-layout after quiting ediff. If nil
     then ediff decides in which frame it will run - depending on the current
     window-layout (e.g. if the ecb-windows are currently hidden) this can be
     the ecb-frame but this can also be a newly created frame or any other
     frame.

 -- User Option: stealthy-tasks-delay
     Time Emacs must be idle before ECB runs its stealthy tasks. Currently
     ECB performes the following stealthy tasks:

    Prescann directories for emptyness
          Prescann directories and display them as empty or not-empty in the
          directories-buffer. See the documentation of the option
          `ecb-prescan-directories-for-emptyness' for a description.

    File is read only
          Check if sourcefile-items of the directories- or sources-buffer are
          read-only or not. See documentation of the option
          `ecb-sources-perform-read-only-check'.

    Version-control-state
          Checks the version-control-state of files in directories which are
          managed by a VC-backend. See the option `ecb-vc-enable-support'.


     Here the interval is defined ECB has to be idle before starting with
     these stealthy tasks. It can be a floating-point value in seconds. The
     value can also be changed during running ECB.

 -- User Option: tip-of-the-day
     Show tip of the day at start time of ECB.

 -- User Option: tip-of-the-day-file
     File where tip-of-the-day cursor is stored.

 -- User Option: use-recursive-edit
     Tell ECB to use a recursive edit. If set then it can easily be
     deactivated by (keyboard-escape-quit).

 -- User Option: version-check
     Checks at start-time if the requirements are fulfilled.  It checks if
     the required versions of the libraries semantic, eieio and speedbar are
     installed and loaded into Emacs.

     It is strongly recommended to set this option to not `nil'!

 -- User Option: window-sync
     Synchronize the ECB-windows automatically with current edit window. If
     `always' then the synchronization takes place always a buffer changes in
     the edit window, if `nil' then never. If a list of major-modes then only
     if the `major-mode' of the new buffer belongs NOT to this list.

     But in every case the synchronization only takes place if the
     current-buffer in the current active edit-window has a relation to files
     or directories. Examples for the former one are all
     programming-language-modes, `Info-mode' too, an example for the latter
     one is `dired-mode'. For all major-modes related to
     non-file/directory-buffers like `help-mode', `customize-mode' and others
     never an autom. synchronization will be done!

     It's recommended to exclude at least `Info-mode' because it makes no
     sense to synchronize the ECB-windows after calling the Info help.  Per
     default also `dired-mode' is excluded but it can also making sense to
     synchronize the ECB-directories/sources windows with the current
     directory in the dired-buffer.

     IMPORTANT NOTE: Every time the synchronization is done the hook
     `ecb-current-buffer-sync-hook' is evaluated.

 -- User Option: window-sync-delay
     Time Emacs must be idle before the ECB-windows are synchronized with
     current edit window. If nil then there is no delay, means
     synchronization takes place immediately. A small value of about 0.25
     seconds saves CPU resources and you get even though almost the same
     effect as if you set no delay.

7.3.2 Group ecb-tree-buffer
---------------------------

This group contains general settings related to the tree-buffers of ECB:

 -- User Option: common-tree-buffer-after-create-hook
     Local hook running at the end of each tree-buffer creation. Every
     function of this hook is called once without arguments direct after
     creating a tree-buffer of ECB and it's local key-map. So for example a
     function could be added which performs calls of `local-set-key' to
     define new keybindings for EVERY tree-buffer.

     The following keys must not be rebind in all tree-buffers:
        - `RET' and all combinations with `Shift' and `Ctrl'

        - `TAB'

        - `C-t'

 -- User Option: primary-secondary-mouse-buttons
     Primary- and secondary mouse button for using the ECB-buffers. A click
     with the primary button causes the main effect in each ECB-buffer:

        * ECB Directories: Expanding/collapsing nodes and displaying files in
          the ECB Sources buffer.

        * ECB sources/history: Opening the file in that edit-window specified
          by the option `ecb-mouse-click-destination'.

        * ECB Methods: Jumping to the method in that edit-window specified by
          the option `ecb-mouse-click-destination'.

     A click with the primary mouse-button while the SHIFT-key is pressed
     called the POWER-click and does the following (depending on the
     ECB-buffer where the POWER-click occurs):

        * ECB Directories: Refreshing the directory-contents-cache (see
          `ecb-cache-directory-contents').

        * ECB sources/history: Only displaying the source-contents in the
          method-buffer but not displaying the source-file in the edit-window.

        * ECB Methods: Narrowing to the clicked method/variable/ect... (see
          `ecb-tag-visit-post-actions'). This works only for semantic
          supported sources but not for imenu- or etags-supported ones!

     In addition always the whole node-name is displayed in the minibuffer
     after a POWER-click \(for this see also
     `ecb-show-node-info-in-minibuffer').

     The secondary mouse-button is for opening (jumping to) the file in
     another edit-window (see the documentation
     `ecb-mouse-click-destination').

     The following combinations are possible:

        - primary: mouse-2, secondary: C-mouse-2 (means mouse-2 while
          CTRL-key is pressed). This is the default setting.

        - primary: mouse-1, secondary: C-mouse-1

        - primary: mouse-1, secondary: mouse-2

     Please note: If the tree-buffers are used with the keyboard instead with
     the mouse then `RET' is interpreted as primary mouse-button and `C-RET'
     as secondary mouse-button!

     If you change this during ECB is activated you must deactivate and
     activate ECB again to take effect

 -- User Option: tree-buffer-style
     The style of the tree-buffers.  There are three different styles
     available:

     Image-style (value `image'): Very nice and modern - just try it.  For
     this style the options `ecb-tree-indent' and
     `ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before' have no effect! Note: GNU Emacs <=
     21.3.X for Windows does not support image-display so ECB uses always
     'ascii-guides even when here 'image is set!

     Ascii-style with guide-lines (value `ascii-guides'):
        [-] ECB
         |  [+] code-save
         `- [-] ecb-images
             |  [-] directories
             |   |  [-] height-15
             |   |   |  * close.xpm
             |   |   |  * empty.xpm
             |   |   |  * leaf.xpm
             |   |   `- * open.xpm
             |   |  [+] height-17
             |   |  [+] height-19
             |   `- [+] height-21
             |  [x] history
             |  [x] methods
             `- [x] sources

     Ascii-style without guide-lines (value `ascii-no-guides') - this is the
     style used by ECB <= 1.96:
        [-] ECB
            [+] code-save
            [-] ecb-images
                [-] directories
                    [-] height-15
                        * close.xpm
                        * empty.xpm
                        * leaf.xpm
                        * open.xpm
                    [+] height-17
                    [+] height-19
                    [+] height-21
                [x] history
                [x] methods
                [x] sources

     With both ascii-styles the tree-layout can be affected with the options
     `ecb-tree-indent' and `ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before'.

 -- User Option: tree-do-not-leave-window-after-select
     Tree-buffers which stay selected after a key- or mouse-selection. If a
     buffer (either its name or the variable-symbol which holds the name) is
     contained in this list then selecting a tree-node either by RET or by a
     mouse-click doesn't leave that tree-buffer after the node-selection but
     performes only the appropriate action (opening a new source, selecting a
     method etc.) but point stays in the tree-buffer. In tree-buffers not
     contained in this option normaly a node-selection selects as "last"
     action the right edit-window or maximizes the next senseful tree-buffer
     in case of a currently maximized tree-buffer (see
     `ecb-maximize-next-after-maximized-select').

     The buffer-name can either be defined as plain string or with a symbol
     which contains the buffer-name as value. The latter one is recommended
     for the builtin ECB-tree-buffers because then simply the related
     option-symbol can be used.

     A special remark for the `ecb-directories-buffer-name': Of course here
     the value of this option is only relevant if the name of the current
     layout is contained in `ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer' or if
     the value of `ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer' is 'always and the
     clicked ot hitted node represents a sourcefile (otherwise this would not
     make any sense)!

     The setting in this option is only the default for each tree-buffer.
     With the command `ecb-toggle-do-not-leave-window-after-select' the
     behavior of a node-selection can be changed fast and easy in a
     tree-buffer without customizing this option, but of course not for
     future Emacs sessions!

 -- User Option: tree-easy-hor-scroll
     Scroll step for easy hor. scrolling via mouse-click in tree-buffers.
     XEmacs has horizontal scroll-bars so invisible parts beyond the right
     window-border of a tree-buffer can always made visible very easy.

     GNU Emacs does not have hor. scroll-bars so especially with the mouse it
     is quite impossible to scroll smoothly right and left. The functions
     `scroll-left' and `scroll-right' can be annoying and are also not bound
     to mouse-buttons.

     If this option is a positive integer S then in all ECB-tree-buffers the
     keys `M-mouse-1' and `M-mouse-3' are bound to scrolling left rsp. right
     with scroll-step S - clicking with `mouse-1' or `mouse-2' onto the edge
     of the modeline has the same effect, i.e.  if you click with mouse-1
     onto the left (rsp right) edge of the modeline you will scroll left
     (rsp. right).

     Additionally `C-M-mouse-1' and `C-M-mouse-3' are bound to scrolling left
     rsp. right with scroll-step `window-width' - 2.

     Default is a scroll-step of 5. If the value is `nil' then no keys for
     horizontal scrolling are bound.

 -- User Option: tree-expand-symbol-before
     Show the expand symbol before the items in a tree. When the
     expand-symbol is located before the items then the tree looks like:

        [-] ECB
            [+] code-save
            [-] ecb-images
                [-] directories

     When located after then the tree looks like:

        ECB [-]
          code-save [+]
          ecb-images [-]
            directories [-]

     The after-example above use a value of 2 for `ecb-tree-indent' whereas
     the before-example uses a value of 4.

     It is recommended to display the expand-symbol before because otherwise
     it could be that with a deep nested item-structure with and/or with long
     item-names (e.g. a deep directory-structure with some long
     subdirectory-names) the expand-symbol is not visible in the tree-buffer
     and the tree-buffer has to be horizontal scrolled to expand an item.

 -- User Option: tree-image-icons-directories
     Directories where the images for the tree-buffer can be found. This is a
     cons cell where:

     car: Default directory where the default images for the tree-buffer can
     be found. It should contain an image for every name of
     `tree-buffer-tree-image-names'. The name of an image-file must be:
     "ecb-<NAME of TREE-BUFFER-TREE-IMAGE-NAMES>.<ALLOWED EXTENSIONS>".

     cdr: This is a list where each element is a cons again with: car is the
     buffer name of the tree-buffer for which a special image-path should be
     used. The buffer-name can either be defined as plain string or with a
     symbol which contains the buffer-name as value. The latter one is
     recommended for the builtin ECB-tree-buffers because then simply the
     related option-symbol can be used (e.g. the symbol
     `ecb-directories-buffer-name'). The cdr is the the full-path of an
     additional image-directorie which is searched first for images needed
     for the related tree-buffer. If the image can not be found in this
     directory then the default-directory (see above) is searched. If the
     image can't even be found there the related ascii-symbol is used - which
     is defined in `tree-buffer-tree-image-names'. If a tree-buffer is not
     contained in this list then there is no additional special
     image-directory for it.

     ECB comes with predefined images in several different heights - so for
     the most senseful font-heights of a tree-buffer a fitting image-size
     should be available. The images reside either in the subdirectory
     "ecb-images" of the ECB-installation or - if ECB is installed as regular
     XEmacs-package - in the ECB-etc data-directory (the directory returned
     by (locate-data-directory "ecb").

 -- User Option: tree-incremental-search
     Enable incremental search in the ECB-tree-buffers. For a detailed
     explanation see the online help section "Working with the keyboard in
     the ECB buffers". If you change this during ECB is activated you must
     deactivate and activate ECB again to take effect.

 -- User Option: tree-indent
     Indent size for tree buffer. If you change this during ECB is activated
     you must deactivate and activate ECB again to take effect.

 -- User Option: tree-mouse-action-trigger
     When the tree-buffer mouse-action should be triggered. This option
     determines the moment a mouse-action in a tree-buffer is triggered.
     This can be either direct after pressing a mouse-button (value
     `button-press') or not until releasing the mouse-button (value:
     `button-release').

     If you change this during ECB is activated you must deactivate and
     activate ECB again to take effect!

 -- User Option: tree-navigation-by-arrow
     Enable smart navigation in the tree-windows by horiz. arrow-keys. If not
     nil then the left- and right-arrow keys work in the ECB tree-window in
     the following smart way if onto an expandable node:

        * Left-arrow: If node is expanded then it will be collapsed otherwise
          point jumps to the next "higher" node in the hierarchical tree
          (higher means the next higher tree-level or - if no higher level
          available - the next higher node on the same level).

        * Right-arrow: If node is not expanded then it will be expanded. Onto
          a not expandable node the horizontal arrow-keys go one character in
          the senseful correct direction.

     If this option is changed the new value takes first effect after
     deactivating ECB and then activating it again!

 -- User Option: tree-truncate-lines
     Truncate lines in ECB buffers. If a buffer (either its name or the
     variable-symbol which holds the name) is contained in this list then
     line-truncation is switched on for this buffer otherwise it is off.

     The buffer-name can either be defined as plain string or with a symbol
     which contains the buffer-name as value. The latter one is recommended
     to switch on line-truncation for one of the builtin ECB-tree-buffers
     because then simply the related option-symbol can be used. To truncate
     lines in the builtin directories tree-buffer just add the symbol
     `ecb-directories-buffer-name' to this option.

     If you change this during ECB is activated you must deactivate and
     activate ECB again to take effect.

 -- User Option: truncate-long-names
     Truncate long names that don't fit in the width of the ECB windows. If
     you change this during ECB is activated you must deactivate and activate
     ECB again to take effect.


File: ecb.info,  Node: ecb-directories,  Next: ecb-sources,  Prev: ecb-tree-buffer,  Up: Customizable options

7.3.3 Group ecb-directories
---------------------------

This group contains settings for the directories-buffer in the ECB:

 -- User Option: add-path-for-not-matching-files
     Add path of a file to `ecb-source-path' if not already contained.  This
     is done during the auto. windows synchronization which happens if a file
     is opened not via the file/directory-browser of ECB. In such a situation
     ECB adds the path of the new file auto. to `ecb-source-path' at least
     temporally for the current Emacs session. This option defines two things:

       1. Should only the root-part (which means for Unix-like systems always
          '/' and for windows-like systems the drive) of the new file be added
          as source-path to `ecb-source-path' or the whole directory-part?
          For remote-files (e.g. tramp, ange-ftp- or efs-files) the root-part
          is the complete host-part + the root-dir at that host (example:
          /berndl@ecb.sourceforge.net:/ would be the root-part of
          /berndl@ecb.sourceforge.net:/tmp/test.txt).

       2. Should this path be added for future sessions too?

     The value of this option is a cons-cell where the car is a boolean for
     1. and the cdr is a boolean for 2.

     A value of not nil for the car (1.) is reasonably if a user often opens
     files not via the ECB-browser which are not located in any of the paths
     of `ecb-source-path' because then only one path for each drive (windows)
     or the root-path (Unix) is added to the directory buffer of ECB.

 -- User Option: auto-expand-directory-tree
     Automatically expand the directory tree to the current source file.
     There are three options:

        - `best': Expand the best-matching source-path

        - `first': Expand the first matching source-path

        - `nil': Do not automatically expand the directory tree.

 -- User Option: after-directory-change-hook
     Hook which run directly after the selected directory has changed. This
     means not onyl after a click onto a directory in the directory-window of
     ECB but it means this hook runs always when the current directory
     changes regardless of the trigger of this change. So for example it runs
     also when you just switches from one buffer to another via
     `switch-to-buffer' or `switch-to-buffer-other-window' and the directory
     of these filebuffers is different but only when auto-synchronizing of
     the ECB-windows is on (see `ecb-window-sync'). It runs not when
     switching between buffers and the associated files reside in the same
     directory.

     Each function added to this hook will be called with two arguments: The
     directory which was current _before_ the directory-change-trigger and
     the directory which was now the current (i.e. after the trigger).

     Example: If you switch from a filebuffer "~/.emacs" to a filebuffer
     "/tmp/test.txt" then the functions of this hook will be called with the
     two arguments "~" and "/tmp".

 -- User Option: cache-directory-contents
     Cache contents of directories.

     This can be useful if `ecb-source-path' contains directories with many
     files and subdirs, especially if these directories are mounted
     net-drives ("many" means here something > 500, dependent of the speed of
     the net-connection and the machine). Or if it contains
     remote-source-paths which means paths in the sense of tramp, ange-ftp or
     efs. For these directories actualizing the sources- and/or directories-
     buffer of ECB (if displayed in current layout!) can slow down
     dramatically so a caching increases speed a lot.

     The value of this option is a list where each element is a cons-cell and
     looks like:

          (<dir-regexp> . <filenumber threshold>) with

    `<dir-regexp>:'
          Regular expression a directory must match to be cached.

    `<filenumber threshold>:'
          Number of directory contents must exceed this number.

     A directory will only be cached if and only if the directory-name
     matches at least one rexexp of this option and its content-number
     exceeds the related threshold AND the directory-name matches NOT any
     regexp of `ecb-cache-directory-contents-not'!

     The cache entry for a certain directory will be refreshed and actualized
     only by using the POWER-click (see
     `ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons') in the directories-buffer of ECB
     (*note Using the mouse::).

     Default-value: ECB caches the contents of all remote directories
     regardless of the size and all other directories if more than 50 entries
     are contained.

     Examples:

     An entry `("/usr/home/john_smith/bigdir*" . 1000)' means the contents of
     every subdirectory of the home-directory of John Smith will be cached if
     the directory contains more than 1000 entries and its name begins with
     "bigdir".

     An entry `(".*" . 1000)' caches every directory which has more than 1000
     entries.

     An entry `("^/\\([^:/]*@\\)?\\([^@:/]*\\):.*" . 0)' caches every remote
     (in the sense of tramp, ange-ftp or efs) directory regardless of the
     number of entries."

     Please note: If you want your home-dir being cached then you MUST NOT
     use "~" because ECB tries always to match full path-names!

 -- User Option: cache-directory-contents-not
     Do not cache the contents of certain directories. The value of this
     option is a list where the each element is a regular expression a
     directory must match if it should not being cached.

     If a directory-name matches at least one of the regexps of this option
     the directory-contents will never being cached. See
     `ecb-cache-directory-contents' to see when a directory will be cached.

     This option can be useful when normally all directories with a certain
     amount of content (files and subdirs) should be cached but some special
     directories not. This can be achieved by:

        - Setting `ecb-cache-directory-contents' to ((".*" . 500)): Caches
          all directories with more then 500 entries

        - Setting `ecb-cache-directory-contents-not' to a value which matches
          these directories which should not being cached (e.g.
          ("/usr/home/john_smith") excludes the HOME-directory of John Smith
          from being cached).

     Please note: If you want your home-dir exclude from being cached then
     you MUST NOT use "~" because ECB tries always to match full path-names!

 -- User Option: directories-buffer-after-create-hook
     Local hook running after the creation of the directories-buffer. Every
     function of this hook is called once without arguments direct after
     creating the directories-buffer of ECB and it's local key-map. So for
     example a function could be added which performs calls of
     `local-set-key' to define new keybindings only for the
     directories-buffer of ECB.

     The following keys must not be rebind in the directories-buffer: `F2',
     `F3' and `F4'

 -- User Option: directories-buffer-name
     Name of the ECB directory buffer. Because it is not a normal buffer for
     editing you should enclose the name with stars, e.g. " *ECB
     Directories*".

     If it is necessary for you you can get emacs-lisp access to the
     buffer-object of the ECB-directory-buffer by this name, e.g. by a call
     of `set-buffer'.

     Changes for this option at runtime will take affect only after
     deactivating and then activating ECB again!

 -- User Option: directories-menu-sorter
     Function which re-sorts the menu-entries of the directories buffer.

     If a function then this function is called to re-arrange the
     menu-entries of the combined menu-entries of the user-menu-extensions of
     `ecb-directories-menu-user-extension' and the built-in-menu
     `ecb-directories-menu'. If nil then no special sorting will be done and
     the user-extensions are placed in front of the built-in-entries.

     The function get one argument, a list of menu-entries. For the format of
     this argument see `ecb-directories-menu-user-extension'. The function
     must return a new list in the same format. Of course this function can
     not only re-arrange the entries but also delete entries or add new
     entries.

 -- User Option: directories-menu-user-extension
     Static user extensions for the popup-menu of the directories buffer.
     Value is a list of elements of the following type: Each element defines
     a new menu-entry and is either:

       1. Menu-command: A list containing two sub-elements, whereas the first
          is the function (a function symbol) being called if the menu-entry
          is selected and the second is the name of the menu-entry.

       2. Separator: A one-element-list and the element is the string "--":
          Then a non-selectable menu-separator is displayed.

       3. Submenu: A list where the first element is the title of the submenu
          displayed in the main-menu and all other elements are either
          menu-commands (see 1) or separators (see 2) or another submenu (see
          c). This allows deep nested menu-submenu-structures. Currently a
          level of 4 is allowed but in general there could be an infinite
          depth of nesting but it makes no sense - if possible at all - to
          define infinite nested defcustom-types. So there is a limit of 4
          levels but tis is not a hard limit: Just increase the value of the
          `ecb-max-submenu-depth' *BEFORE* first loading ECB!

     The function of a menu-command must follow the following guidelines:
     Such a function must be defined with the macro
     `tree-buffer-defpopup-command'! This macro defines a new popup-command
     whereas the newly defined command gets one argument NODE. See the
     docstring of `tree-buffer-defpopup-command' for further details.

     Example for the definition of such a menu-function:

        (tree-buffer-defpopup-command ecb-my-special-dir-popup-function
          "Prints the name of the directory of the node under point."
          (let ((node-data=dir (tree-node-get-data node)))
             (message ``Dir under node: %s'' node-data=dir)))

     Per default the static user-extensions are added at the beginning of the
     built-in menu-entries of `ecb-directories-menu' but the whole menu can
     be re-arranged with `ecb-directories-menu-sorter'.

     These menu-extensions are static. A dynamic menu-extension can be
     achieved via `ecb-directories-menu-user-extension-function'.

 -- User Option: directories-menu-user-extension-function
     Dynamic user extensions for the popup-menu of the directories buffer.  A
     function which has to return a list in the same format like the option
     `ecb-directories-menu-user-extension'. This function is called when the
     user opens the popup-menu for the directories buffer.

     If no dynamically evaluated menu-extensions should be added to the
     directories-buffer the function has to return nil. Therefore the
     default-value of this option is `ignore'.

     Per default the dynamic user-extensions are added in front of the static
     extensions of `ecb-directories-menu-user-extension' but the whole menu
     can be re-arranged with `ecb-directories-menu-sorter'.

 -- User Option: directories-show-node-info
     When to display which node-info in the directories-buffer. Define which
     node info should displayed after moving the mouse over a node (or after
     a shift click onto the node) in the directories-buffer.

     You can define "when" a node-info should be displayed:

        - always: Node info is displayed by moving with the mouse over a node.

        - if-too-long: Node info is only displayed by moving with the mouse
          over a node does not fit into the window-width of the tree-buffer
          window. In the ECB directories buffer this means also if a node is
          shortend or if the node has an alias (see `ecb-source-path').

        - shift-click: Node info is only displayed after a shift click with
          the primary mouse button onto the node.

        - never: Node info is never displayed.

     You can define what info should be displayed:

        - name: Only the full node-name is displayed.

        - path: The full-path of the node is displayed.

     Do NOT set this option directly via setq but use always customize!

 -- User Option: display-default-dir-after-start
     Automatically display current default-directory after activating ECB.

     If a file-buffer is displayed in the current active edit-window then ECB
     synchronizes its tree-buffers to this file-buffer - at least if the
     option `ecb-window-sync' it not nil. So for this situation
     `ecb-display-default-dir-after-start' takes no effect but this option is
     for the case if no file-buffer is displayed in the edit-window after
     startup:

     If true then ECB selects autom. the current default-directory after
     activation even if no file-buffer is displayed in the current active
     edit-window. This is useful if ECB is autom. activated after startup of
     Emacs and Emacs is started without a file-argument. So the directory
     from which the startup has performed is auto. selected in the
     ECB-directories buffer and the ECB-sources buffer displays the contents
     of this directory.

 -- User Option: excluded-directories-regexps
     Directories that should not be included in the directories list. The
     value of this variable should be a list of regular expression.

 -- User Option: prescan-directories-for-emptyness
     Prescan directories for emptyness. ECB does this so directories are
     displayed as empty in the directories-buffer even without
     user-interaction (i.e. in previous ECB-versions the emptyness of a
     directory has been first checked when the user has clicked onto a
     directory). ECB optimizes this check as best as possible but if a
     directory contains a lot of subdirectories which contain in turn a lot
     of entries, then expanding such a directory or selecting it would take
     of course more time as without this check - at least at the first time
     (all following selects of a directory uses the cached information if its
     subdirectories are empty or not). Therefore ECB performs this check
     stealthy (see `ecb-stealthy-tasks-delay') so normally there should no
     performance-decrease or additional waiting-time for the user. There is
     one exception: For remote directories (in the sense of tramp, ange-ftp,
     or efs) this check can descrease performance even if performed stealthy
     and interruptable. Therefore this option offers three possible settings:

        * `t' Switch on this feature

        * `unless-remote' Switch on this feature but not for remote
          directories. The term "remote" means here directories which are
          used via tramp, ange-ftp or efs. So mounted directories are counted
          not as remote directories here even if such a directory is maybe
          hosted on a remote machine. But normally only directories in a LAN
          are mounted so there should be no performance-problems with such
          mounted directories.

        * `nil' Switch off this feature completely.

     The option `ecb-prescan-directories-exclude-regexps' offers are more
     fine granularity to exclude certain directories from this prescan.

 -- User Option: host-accessible-check-valid-time
     Time in seconds a cached accessible-state of a remote host is valid.
     This option is a list where each element specifies how long for a
     certain remote host the cached ping-state (i.e. if the host is
     accessible or not) should be valid. During this time-intervall ECB pings
     such a remote host only once, all other checks use the cached value of
     that real check. But it the cached value is older than the value of this
     option ECB will ping again.

     Per default ECB discards after 1 minute the cached ping-state of each
     remote host. But if you are sure that a certain remote host is always
     accessible (i.e. means in consequence that you are always online when
     working with ECB and remote-paths) then add an entry to this option with
     a high valid-interval.

     Examples: An entry (".*sourceforge.*" . 3600) ensures that all remote
     hosts machting the string "sourceforge" will only once pinged during one
     hour. Or (".*" . 300) would ensure that every remote host would be
     pinged only once during 5 minutes.

 -- User Option: ping-options
     List of options for the ping program. These options can be used to limit
     how many ICMP packets are emitted. Ping is used to test if a remote host
     of a remote path (e.g. a tramp-, ange-ftp- or efs-path) is accessible
     See also `ecb-ping-program'.

 -- User Option: ping-program
     Program to send network test packets to a host. See also
     `ecb-ping-options'.

 -- User Option: prescan-directories-exclude-regexps
     Which directories should be excluded from the empty-prescan. If a
     directory matches any of the regexps of this option it will not be
     prescanned for emptyness - This option takes only effect if
     `ecb-prescan-directories-for-emptyness' is not nil.

 -- User Option: show-sources-in-directories-buffer
     Show source files in directories buffer.

 -- User Option: source-path
     Paths where to find code sources. Each path can have an optional alias
     that is used as it's display name. If no alias is set, the path is used
     as display name.

 -- User Option: source-path
     Paths where to find code sources. Each path can have an optional alias
     that is used as it's display name. If no alias is set, the path is used
     as display name.

     Lisp-type of tis option: The value must be a list L whereas each element
     of L is either
        - a simple string which has to be the full path of a directory (this
          string is displayed in the directory-browser of ECB) or

        - a 2-element list whereas the first element is the full path of a
          directory (string) and the second element is an arbitrary alias
          (string) for this directory which is then displayed instead of the
          underlying directory.

 -- User Option: use-speedbar-instead-native-tree-buffer
     If true then uses speedbar for directories, sources or methods. This
     means that speedbar is integrated in the ECB-frame and is displayed in
     that window normally displaying the standard ECB-directories-buffer,
     ECB-sources-buffer or ECB-methods-buffer.

     This option takes effect in all layouts which contain either a directory
     window, a sources window or a method window.

     This option can have four valid values:
        - `nil': Do not use speedbar (default)

        - `dir': Use speedbar instead of the standard directories-buffer

        - `source': Use speedbar instead of the standard sources-buffer

        - `method': Use speedbar instead of the standard methods-buffer

     Note: For directories and sources a similar effect and usability is
     available by setting this option to `nil' (or `method') and setting
     `ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer' to not `nil', because this
     combination displays also directories and sources in one window.

     `ecb-use-speedbar-instead-native-tree-buffer' is for people who like the
     speedbar way handling directories and source-files or methods and want
     it in conjunction with ECB.

7.3.4 Group ecb-sources
-----------------------

This group contains settings for the sources-buffer in the ECB:

 -- User Option: read-only-check-exclude-regexps
     Which directories should be excluded from the sources-read-only-check.
     If a directory matches any of the regexps of this option their sources
     will not be checked if they are writable - This option takes only effect
     if `ecb-sources-perform-read-only-check' is not nil.

 -- User Option: show-source-file-extension
     Show the file extension of source files.

 -- User Option: source-file-regexps
     Specifies which files are shown as source files.

     This is done on directory-base, which means for each directory-regexp
     the files to display can be specified. If more than one directory-regexp
     matches the current selected directory then always the first one (and
     its related file-exclude/include-regexps) is used! If no
     directory-regexp matches then all files are displayed for the currently
     selected directory.

     Important note: It is recommended that the *LAST* element of this list
     should contain an always matching directory-regexp (`".*"')!

     So the value of this option is a list of cons-cells where the car is a
     directory regexp and the cdr is a 2 element list where the first element
     is a list of exclude regexps and the second element is a list of include
     regexps. A file is displayed in the source-buffer of ECB iff: The file
     does not match any of the exclude regexps OR the file matches at least
     one of the include regexps.

     But regardless of the value of this option a file F is never displayed
     in the sources-buffer if the directory matches
     `ecb-sources-exclude-cvsignore' and the directory contains a file
     .cvsignore which contains F as an entry!

     There are three predefined and useful combinations of an exclude and
     include regexp:

        * All files

        * All, but no backup, object, lib or ini-files (except .emacs and
          .gnus). This means all files except those starting with ".", "#" or
          ending with "~", ".elc", ".obj", ".o", ".lib", ".dll", ".a", ".so".
          (but including .emacs and .gnus)

        * Common source file types (.c, .java etc.)

     In addition to these predefined values a custom exclude and include
     combination can be defined.

     Tips for the directory- and file-rexexps: `"$^"' matches no
     files/directories, `".*"' matches all files/directories.

 -- User Option: sources-buffer-after-create-hook
     Local hook running after the creation of the sources-buffer. Every
     function of this hook is called once without arguments direct after
     creating the sources-buffer of ECB and it's local key-map. So for
     example a function could be added which performs calls of
     `local-set-key' to define new keybindings only for the sources-buffer of
     ECB.

 -- User Option: sources-buffer-name
     Name of the ECB sources buffer. Because it is not a normal buffer for
     editing you should enclose the name with stars, e.g. "*ECB Sources*".

     If it is necessary for you you can get emacs-lisp access to the
     buffer-object of the ECB-sources-buffer by this name, e.g. by a call of
     `set-buffer'.

     Changes for this option at runtime will take affect only after
     deactivating and then activating ECB again!

 -- User Option: sources-exclude-cvsignore
     Specify if files contained in a `.cvsignore' should be excluded.

     Value is a list of regular expressions or nil. If you want to exclude
     files listed in a `.cvsignore'-file from being displayed in the
     ecb-sources-buffer then specify a regexp for such a directory.

     If you want to exclude the contents of `.cvsignore'-files for every
     directory then you should add one regexp ".*" which matches every
     directory.

     If you never want to exclude the contents of `.cvsignore'-files then set
     this option to nil.

 -- User Option: sources-menu-sorter
     Function which re-sorts the menu-entries of the directories buffer.

     If a function then this function is called to sort the menu-entries of
     the combined menu-entries of the user-menu-extensions of
     `ecb-sources-menu-user-extension' and the built-in-menu
     `ecb-sources-menu'. If nil then no special sorting will be done and the
     user-extensions are placed in front of the built-in-entries.

     For the guidelines for such a sorter-function see
     `ecb-directories-menu-sorter'.

 -- User Option: sources-menu-user-extension
     Static user extensions for the popup-menu of the sources buffer. For
     further explanations see `ecb-directories-menu-user-extension'.

     The node-argument of a menu-function contains as data the filename of
     the source for which the popup-menu has been opened.

     Per default the static user-extensions are added at the beginning of the
     built-in menu-entries of `ecb-sources-menu' but the whole menu can be
     re-arranged with `ecb-sources-menu-sorter'.

 -- User Option: sources-menu-user-extension-function
     Dynamic user extensions for the popup-menu of the sources buffer. A
     function which has to return a list in the same format like the option
     `ecb-sources-menu-user-extension'. This function is called when the user
     opens the popup-menu for the sources buffer.

     If no dynamically evaluated menu-extensions should be added to the
     sources-buffer the function has to return nil. Therefore the
     default-value of this option is `ignore'.

     Per default the dynamic user-extensions are added in front of the static
     extensions of `ecb-sources-menu-user-extension' but the whole menu can
     be re-arranged with `ecb-sources-menu-sorter'.

 -- User Option: sources-perform-read-only-check
     Check if source-items in the tree-buffers are read-only. If a sourcefile
     is read-only then it will be displayed with that face set in the option
     `ecb-source-read-only-face'.

     Because this check can be take some time if files are used via a mounted
     net-drive ECB performs this check stealthily (see
     `ecb-stealthy-tasks-delay') so normally the user should not see a
     performance-decrease or additional waiting-time. But to get sure this
     option offers three choices: `t', `unless-remote' and `nil'. See
     `ecb-prescan-directories-for-emptyness' for an explanation for these
     three choices.

     The option `ecb-read-only-check-exclude-regexps' offers are more fine
     granularity to exclude the sources of certain directories from the
     read-only state-check.

 -- User Option: sources-show-node-info
     When to display which node-info in the sources-buffer. Define which node
     info should displayed after moving the mouse over a node (or after a
     shift click onto the node) in the sources-buffer.

     You can define "when" a node-info should be displayed: See
     `ecb-directories-show-node-info' for the possible choices.

     You can define what info should be displayed:
        - name: Only the full node-name is displayed.

        - file-info: File infos for this file are displayed.

        - file-info-full: Fill infos incl. full path for this file are
          displayed.

     Do NOT set this option directly via setq but use always customize!

 -- User Option: sources-sort-ignore-case
     Ignore case for sorting the source-files of the Sources-buffer. See also
     `ecb-sources-sort-method'.

 -- User Option: sources-sort-method
     Defines how the source files are sorted.

        - `name': Sorting by name.

        - `extension': Sorting first by extension and then by name.

        - `nil': No sorting, means source files are displayed in the sequence
          returned by `directory-files' (called without sorting).
