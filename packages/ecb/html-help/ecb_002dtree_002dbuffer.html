<h4 class="subsection">7.3.2 Group ecb-tree-buffer</h4>

<p class="noindent">This group contains general settings related to the tree-buffers of
ECB:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>common-tree-buffer-after-create-hook</b><var><a name="index-common_002dtree_002dbuffer_002dafter_002dcreate_002dhook-153"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Local hook running at the end of each tree-buffer creation. Every
function of this hook is called once without arguments direct after
creating a tree-buffer of ECB and it's local key-map. So for example a
function could be added which performs calls of <code>local-set-key</code>
to define new keybindings for EVERY tree-buffer.

        <p>The following keys must not be rebind in all tree-buffers:
          <ul>
<li><kbd>RET</kbd> and all combinations with <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
<li><kbd>TAB</kbd>
<li><code>C-t</code>
</ul>
        </p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>primary-secondary-mouse-buttons</b><var><a name="index-primary_002dsecondary_002dmouse_002dbuttons-154"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Primary- and secondary mouse button for using the ECB-buffers. A click
with the primary button causes the main effect in each ECB-buffer:

          <ul>
<li>ECB Directories:
Expanding/collapsing nodes and displaying files in the ECB
Sources buffer.

          <li>ECB sources/history:
Opening the file in that edit-window specified by the option
<code>ecb-mouse-click-destination</code>.

          <li>ECB Methods:
Jumping to the method in that edit-window specified by the option
<code>ecb-mouse-click-destination</code>. 
</ul>

        <p>A click with the primary mouse-button while the SHIFT-key is pressed called
the POWER-click and does the following (depending on the ECB-buffer where the
POWER-click occurs):

          <ul>
<li>ECB Directories:
Refreshing the directory-contents-cache (see
<code>ecb-cache-directory-contents</code>).

          <li>ECB sources/history:
Only displaying the source-contents in the method-buffer but not
displaying the source-file in the edit-window.

          <li>ECB Methods:
Narrowing to the clicked method/variable/ect... (see
<code>ecb-tag-visit-post-actions</code>). This works only for semantic
supported sources but not for imenu- or etags-supported ones! 
</ul>

        <p>In addition always the whole node-name is displayed in the minibuffer after a
POWER-click \(for this see also `ecb-show-node-info-in-minibuffer').

        <p>The secondary mouse-button is for opening (jumping to) the file in
another edit-window (see the documentation
<code>ecb-mouse-click-destination</code>).

        <p>The following combinations are possible:

          <ul>
<li>primary: mouse-2, secondary: C-mouse-2 (means mouse-2 while CTRL-key is
pressed). This is the default setting. 
<li>primary: mouse-1, secondary: C-mouse-1
<li>primary: mouse-1, secondary: mouse-2
</ul>

        <p>Please note: If the tree-buffers are used with the keyboard instead
with the mouse then <kbd>RET</kbd> is interpreted as primary mouse-button and
<kbd>C-RET</kbd> as secondary mouse-button!

        <p>If you change this during ECB is activated you must deactivate and
activate ECB again to take effect

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>tree-buffer-style</b><var><a name="index-tree_002dbuffer_002dstyle-155"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The style of the tree-buffers. 
There are three different styles available:

        <p>Image-style (value <code>image</code>): Very nice and modern - just try it. 
For this style the options <code>ecb-tree-indent</code> and
<code>ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before</code> have no effect! Note: GNU Emacs
&lt;= 21.3.X for Windows does not support image-display so ECB uses
always 'ascii-guides even when here 'image is set!

        <p>Ascii-style with guide-lines (value <code>ascii-guides</code>):
     <pre class="example">        [-] ECB
         |  [+] code-save
         `- [-] ecb-images
             |  [-] directories
             |   |  [-] height-15
             |   |   |  * close.xpm
             |   |   |  * empty.xpm
             |   |   |  * leaf.xpm
             |   |   `- * open.xpm
             |   |  [+] height-17
             |   |  [+] height-19
             |   `- [+] height-21
             |  [x] history
             |  [x] methods
             `- [x] sources
   </pre>
        <p>Ascii-style without guide-lines (value <code>ascii-no-guides</code>) - this
is the style used by ECB &lt;= 1.96:
     <pre class="example">        [-] ECB
            [+] code-save
            [-] ecb-images
                [-] directories
                    [-] height-15
                        * close.xpm
                        * empty.xpm
                        * leaf.xpm
                        * open.xpm
                    [+] height-17
                    [+] height-19
                    [+] height-21
                [x] history
                [x] methods
                [x] sources
   </pre>
        <p>With both ascii-styles the tree-layout can be affected with the
options <code>ecb-tree-indent</code> and
<code>ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>tree-do-not-leave-window-after-select</b><var><a name="index-tree_002ddo_002dnot_002dleave_002dwindow_002dafter_002dselect-156"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Tree-buffers which stay selected after a key- or mouse-selection. If a
buffer (either its name or the variable-symbol which holds the name)
is contained in this list then selecting a tree-node either by RET or
by a mouse-click doesn't leave that tree-buffer after the
node-selection but performes only the appropriate action (opening a
new source, selecting a method etc.) but point stays in the
tree-buffer. In tree-buffers not contained in this option normaly a
node-selection selects as &ldquo;last&rdquo; action the right edit-window or
maximizes the next senseful tree-buffer in case of a currently
maximized tree-buffer (see
<code>ecb-maximize-next-after-maximized-select</code>).

        <p>The buffer-name can either be defined as plain string or with a symbol
which contains the buffer-name as value. The latter one is recommended
for the builtin ECB-tree-buffers because then simply the related
option-symbol can be used.

        <p>A special remark for the <code>ecb-directories-buffer-name</code>: Of course
here the value of this option is only relevant if the name of the
current layout is contained in
<code>ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer</code> or if the value of
<code>ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer</code> is 'always and the
clicked ot hitted node represents a sourcefile (otherwise this would
not make any sense)!

        <p>The setting in this option is only the default for each tree-buffer. 
With the command <code>ecb-toggle-do-not-leave-window-after-select</code>
the behavior of a node-selection can be changed fast and easy in a
tree-buffer without customizing this option, but of course not for
future Emacs sessions! 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>tree-easy-hor-scroll</b><var><a name="index-tree_002deasy_002dhor_002dscroll-157"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Scroll step for easy hor. scrolling via mouse-click in tree-buffers. 
XEmacs has horizontal scroll-bars so invisible parts beyond the right
window-border of a tree-buffer can always made visible very easy.

        <p>GNU Emacs does not have hor. scroll-bars so especially with the mouse
it is quite impossible to scroll smoothly right and left. The
functions <code>scroll-left</code> and <code>scroll-right</code> can be annoying
and are also not bound to mouse-buttons.

        <p>If this option is a positive integer S then in all ECB-tree-buffers
the keys <kbd>M-mouse-1</kbd> and <code>M-mouse-3</code> are bound to scrolling
left rsp. right with scroll-step S - clicking with <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> or
<kbd>mouse-2</kbd> onto the edge of the modeline has the same effect, i.e. 
if you click with mouse-1 onto the left (rsp right) edge of the
modeline you will scroll left (rsp. right).

        <p>Additionally <code>C-M-mouse-1</code> and <code>C-M-mouse-3</code> are bound to
scrolling left rsp. right with scroll-step <code>window-width</code> - 2.

        <p>Default is a scroll-step of 5. If the value is <code>nil</code> then no keys
for horizontal scrolling are bound. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>tree-expand-symbol-before</b><var><a name="index-tree_002dexpand_002dsymbol_002dbefore-158"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Show the expand symbol before the items in a tree. When the
expand-symbol is located before the items then the tree looks like:

     <pre class="example">        [-] ECB
            [+] code-save
            [-] ecb-images
                [-] directories
   </pre>
        <p>When located after then the tree looks like:

     <pre class="example">        ECB [-]
          code-save [+]
          ecb-images [-]
            directories [-]
   </pre>
        <p>The after-example above use a value of 2 for <code>ecb-tree-indent</code>
whereas the before-example uses a value of 4.

        <p>It is recommended to display the expand-symbol before because
otherwise it could be that with a deep nested item-structure with
and/or with long item-names (e.g. a deep directory-structure with some
long subdirectory-names) the expand-symbol is not visible in the
tree-buffer and the tree-buffer has to be horizontal scrolled to
expand an item.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>tree-image-icons-directories</b><var><a name="index-tree_002dimage_002dicons_002ddirectories-159"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Directories where the images for the tree-buffer can be found. This is
a cons cell where:

        <p>car: Default directory where the default images for the tree-buffer
can be found. It should contain an image for every name of
<code>tree-buffer-tree-image-names</code>. The name of an image-file must
be: &ldquo;ecb-&lt;NAME of TREE-BUFFER-TREE-IMAGE-NAMES&gt;.&lt;ALLOWED
EXTENSIONS&gt;&rdquo;.

        <p>cdr: This is a list where each element is a cons again with: car is
the buffer name of the tree-buffer for which a special image-path
should be used. The buffer-name can either be defined as plain string
or with a symbol which contains the buffer-name as value. The latter
one is recommended for the builtin ECB-tree-buffers because then
simply the related option-symbol can be used (e.g. the symbol
<code>ecb-directories-buffer-name</code>). The cdr is the the full-path of
an additional image-directorie which is searched first for images
needed for the related tree-buffer. If the image can not be found in
this directory then the default-directory (see above) is searched. If
the image can't even be found there the related ascii-symbol is used -
which is defined in <code>tree-buffer-tree-image-names</code>. If a
tree-buffer is not contained in this list then there is no additional
special image-directory for it.

        <p>ECB comes with predefined images in several different heights - so for
the most senseful font-heights of a tree-buffer a fitting image-size
should be available. The images reside either in the subdirectory
&ldquo;ecb-images&rdquo; of the ECB-installation or - if ECB is installed as
regular XEmacs-package - in the ECB-etc data-directory (the directory
returned by (locate-data-directory &ldquo;ecb&rdquo;).
