;; Generates the ECB website. This files generates seven files: main.html,

;; javabrowser.html. These files will be used by the start-file index.html and

;; Do not change any html-file besides the index.html manually but do all

                        and also mostly with XEmacs. ECB is able to work with
                        indirect buffers if the base-buffer is filebased. It
                        has a complete reworked history-buffer which can be
                        bucketized and shows dead- and indirect-buffers in
