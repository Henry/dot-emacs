<h2>What is The Insidious Big Brother Database?</h2>

<p>The Insidious Big Brother Database (BBDB) is a contact management
utility created by <a href="http://www.jwz.org/">Jamie Zawinski</a> for
use with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/emacs">Emacs</a>.  For many years it was
maintained by <a href="http://www.waider.ie/">Waider</a>.  Since February 2007
BBDB is maintained by <a href="http://www.robf.de">Robert Widhopf-Fenk</a>.</p> 

<p>It is tightly
integrated with several mail and news readers (see below), allowing it
to create database entries directly from mail and news messages.  As is 
usual with applications for Emacs, this record creation can be
configured in many ways, ranging from a boolean create/don't create
setting to creation based on the result of a user-supplied function.</p>

<p>Database records can be used to store many types of
information, from name and address to URLs and X-Face images.
This information can be displayed when a message from an entity
named in a database record is recieved.  In addition, messages
from database members can be tagged in the Gnus Summary Buffer,
and Gnus scoring can be configured based on the contents of
database records.  Supercite citations can even be preset
through the use of records in the BBDB.</p>

<h2>Requirements:</h2>

<h3>Supported versions of Emacs</h3>

Starting with 2.35 there is no active support for Emacsens < 21.4!    
<dl>
 <dt><strong><a href="http://www.gnu.org/">Gnu</a>
   <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a></strong>
  <dd>versions 21.4 and above</dd>
 <dt><strong><a href="http://www.xemacs.org/">XEmacs</a></strong>
  <dd>versions 21.4 and above</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Supported Mail and News readers</h3>

<p>The BBDB can be used without a mail- or news-reader.  It has,
however, been optimized for use with one.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.gnus.org/">Gnus</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.wonderworks.com/vm/">VM</a></li>
  <li>MH-e</li>
  <li>Rmail</li>
  <li>UNIX <a href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</a> Mail

</ul>

<h2><a name="get">Getting the BBDB</a></h2>

<p><a href="bbdb-2.35.tar.gz">BBDB 2.35</a> is the current
stable released version, released on January  30, 2007.</p>

<p>The current development version, 2.36, is the head of the CVS
tree.  If you wish to try it out, you should check it out with CVS as
described below.
    </p>

<h3>Compilation notes:</h3>

<ol>
 <li>BBDB uses autoconf to generate its Makefiles, so it should work
     anywhere that autoconf works. The tarballed version comes with
     prebuilt configure script and Makefiles; the CVS version will
     require you to use autoconf to generate the configure
     script. If you don't have autoconf, you can get download a <a
     href="configure">prebuilt configure script</a>. Please note that
     the Makefiles in the tarball are built using the defaults,
     i.e. Emacs to compile with and no extra directories
     specified.</li>

 <li>Texinfo 3.11 (or later) is required to compile the texinfo
     documentation.  It is available at <a
     href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu">the GNU FTP
     site</a>. Precompiled info files are included in the
     tarball. Some work has been done by ShengHuo ZHU to make this
     unnecessary.</li>

 <li>Building on platforms without <tt>make</tt> or running BBDB
     uncompiled can be assisted by downloading a <a
     href="bbdb-autoloads.el">prebuilt bbdb-autoloads.el</a>. A
     <tt>make.bat</tt> for Windows platforms is in the works; see the
     mailing list archives for more details.
</ol>

<h2>CVS tree</h2>

<p>The development and release versions are available via Anon-CVS
to the CVS tree at <code>bbdb.cvs.sourceforge.net</code>.  To access the
tree, log in with the following command:

<pre>
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@bbdb.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bbdb login
</pre>

The password is blank; just hit return at the prompt.</p>

To check out a version of the BBDB, use one of the following commands:

<pre>
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@bbdb.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bbdb checkout bbdb
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@bbdb.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bbdb checkout -r rev bbdb
</pre>

<p>The first command will check out a copy of the latest version.
Usually this latest version will be a development version, but it may
fetch a release version if the command is executed soon enough after a
release version is made available.</p>

<p>The second command allows control of the version retrieved, through
the <code>-r rev</code> argument.  The <code>rev</code> portion of the
argument should be replaced with a word of the form:</p>

<center><code>BBDB_</code><var>x</var><code>_</code><var>yy</var></center>

<p><var>x</var> and <var>yy</var> are components of the version to be
retrieved, as in <var>x</var>.<var>yy</var>.
<strong>Note:</strong> <code>unoff</code> should be appended to the
above word for all versions prior to 2.00.</p>

To retrieve version 1.90, use the following argument:<br>

<pre>
-r BBDB_1_90unoff
</pre>

To retrieve version 2.34, use the following argument:<br>

<pre>
-r BBDB_2_34
</pre>

<h2><a name="manual">Manual</a></h2>

<p>You may browse <a href="bbdb.html">HTML version of the texinfo
manual that accompanies BBDB</a>, which is generated by <a
href="http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~obachman/Texi2html"
><code>texi2html</code></a>.</p>

<h2><a name="lists">Mailing Lists</a></h2>

<p>There are two mailing lists for the BBDB:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><strong>bbdb-info</strong></dt>
  <dd>General discussion about the BBDB, both for users and developers.
   The archive for mails up to end of April 2000 can be found at
   <a
   href="http://www.mail-archive.com/bbdb-info%40xemacs.org/">http://www.mail-archive.com/bbdb-info%40xemacs.org/</a>. Since April 2000 mails are archived at
   <a
   href="http://www.mail-archive.com/bbdb-info%40lists.sourceforge.net/">http://www.mail-archive.com/bbdb-info%40lists.sourceforge.net/</a>.

  <p>SourceForge has built-in archiving which didn't initially
  seem to be working, but is apparently okay now. You can find this
  linked off the <a
  href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bbdb/">project home</a> on
  SourceForge.</p>

 <dt><strong>bbdb-announce</strong></dt>
  <dd>Announcements of new BBDB versions.  This list is moderated, and
   has very low volume.</dd>
</dl>

To subscribe to either mailing list, send mail to
<var>listname</var><code>-request@lists.sourceforge.net</code> with
<code>subscribe</code> as the body. You will receive a reply
requesting confirmation of your subscription; return the confirmation
as described in the email, and you're on the list. Alternatively you
can visit the list signup page, linked from the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bbdb">project page</a>.

<h2><a name="links">Links</a></h2>

   expiry code for BBDB which allows you to automatically discard old
   BBDB records.</li>

 <li><a
   href="http://www.inf.tu-dresden.de/~s1010824/data/lbdb2bbdb.tar.gz">lbdb2bdb</a>

 <li><a
   href="http://www.neilvandyke.org/bbdb2tbird/">bbdb2tbird</a>
   is some code by Neil Van Dyke to migrate BBDB data to the Thunderbird
   address book.</li>
	  
 <li>The <code>bits</code> subdirectory in the source tree contains
  random bits and pieces that I've collected but not
  integrated, including a generic export filter of sorts and PGP and
  Outlook integration/interaction. Please note that at least some of
  this hasn't been modfied to work with versions later than
  2.00.06.</li>
