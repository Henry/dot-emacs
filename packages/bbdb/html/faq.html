    <h1>The BBDB FAQ</h1>

    The FAQ is unmaintained, but you probably find an answer to your question
    in the mailing list archives.  Feel free to mail me any things that should
    be on this list.
    
	<p>This is the BBDB FAQ, $Revision: 1.6 $.</p>

	<dl>
	  <dt>About BBDB and this document</dt>

			<dt>What is the BBDB?</dt>
			<dd>Updated: 21 July 2000<br>
				<br>
				The BBDB is an addressbook for Emacs[1] users. It integrates
				tightly with Emacs-based mail and news readers, and
				provides some support for Netscape Mail and News. It is
				intended to be as unobtrusive in use as possible.<br>
				<br>
				The full name of BBDB is &quot;The Insidious Big Brother
				Database&quot;.<br><br>
				<em>[1] In this FAQ, &quot;Emacs&quot; refers to both <a
				href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a> and
				<a href="http://www.xemacs.org/">XEmacs</a>.</em><br><br></dd>

			<dt>What is the most current version of the BBDB?</dt>
			<dd>Updated: 20 August 2005<br>
				<br>
				The current stable version is 2.34. The current
				development version is 2.35. Generally speaking, the
				development version is the preferred version.<br><br></dd>

			<dt>Where can I get the most current version of the BBDB?</dt>
			<dd>Updated: 21 July 2000<br>
				<br>
				BBDB is hosted, developed and maintained at <a
				href="http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/">http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/</a>.
				The current stable and development releases are posted
				here.<br><br></dd>

			<dt>About the FAQ<dt>
			<dd>Updated: 25 February 2001<br>
				<br>
				This FAQ is currently being constructed from a
				backlog of saved email messages from the bbdb-info mailing
				list. It is part of the BBDB CVS tree and thus can be
				updated by anyone with write access to the
				tree. Suggestions for additional questions (and answers!)
				can be sent to <a
				href="mailto:bbdb-faq@waider.ie">bbdb-faq@waider.ie</a>.<br>
				<br>
				The FAQ answers assume you have some familiarity with
				Emacs. Where configuration variables are mentioned,
				there's usually a <tt>customize</tt> interface that allows
				you to do point-and-click option setting.<br><br></dd>

			<dt>How do I install BBDB?</dt>
			<dd>Updated: 25 February 2001<br>
				<br>
				Read the file INSTALL in the distribution<br><br></dd>

	<!-- integrate with VM, Gnus, MH-E, RMail -->

	  <dt>Configuring the BBDB</dt>

			<dt>BBDB sometimes displays the user's full name along with
			  some names, and not with others.</dt>
			<dd>Updated: 25 February 2001<br>
			  <br>
			  Set <tt>bbdb-dwim-net-address-allow-redundancy</tt> to
			  <tt>t</tt>. This tells BBDB it's okay to add full names to
			  addresses of the form
			  &lt;Firstname.Lastname@wherever&gt;<br><br></dd>

            <dt>Is there a way to insert literal strings in the phone
              number field?</dt>
            <dd>Updated: July 28 2001<br>
              <br>
              Set <tt>bbdb-north-american-phone-numbers-p</tt> to
              nil. This tells BBDB to not try parsing numbers, but to
              simply accept whatever the user types in.<br><br></dd>

            <dt>How to I get BBDB to not keep changing the name field
              for a record?</dt>
            <dd>Updated: August 20 2005<br>
              Probably the easiest way to do this is to use
              <tt>bbdb-ignore-some-messages-alist</tt>; see the
              documentation on this for more details. You'll also need
              to set <tt>bbdb/{mail,news}-auto-create-p</tt> to
              <tt>bbdb-ignore-some-messages-hook</tt>, or invoke the
              latter from whatever your <tt>auto-create-p</tt>
              variables currently point at.</dd>

	<!-- I guess this question came off the mailing list. It should be
	reformatted & answered.

	"One question I ask me since begin: How can I insert new fields (say
	 for signatures or v-card's) and how the hooks to set/get those new
	 fields? Now, is this a FAQ?"

          <br>
          Type as much of the address as you feel necessary, then
          hit <tt>M-TAB</tt> to get BBDB to attempt to complete what
          you've typed. If it finds several matches, you can loop
          through them by repeatedly pressing <tt>M-TAB</tt>; you can
          also select from a completion-buffer of
          choices.<br><Br></dd> <!-- this isn't strictly true; check

            <dt>How do I submit a bug report?</dt>
            <dd>Updated: 20 August 2005<br>
              Use <tt>bbdb-submit-bug-report</tt>. This extracts
              version information and settings from your running copy
              of BBDB and prepares an email message including
              them. The default address for this mail is the bbdb-info
              list, so that all developers can see it, but if you've
              got privacy issues with that then you can send it
              directly to me (waider@waider.ie). A few essential
              notes:<ul>
              <li>Check the mailing list archives to see if your bug
              has previously been discussed.</li>
              <li>Make sure you've tried out the latest CVS version,
              in case your bug has already been solved.</li>
              <li>Be as precise as you can. Do <b>not</b> use
              wording like &quot;I got an error message about some
              file&quot;; include the exact text of the error message
              and the filename it referred to.</li>
              <li>If you can, try and provide a minimal <tt>.bbdb</tt>
              file that illustrates the problem. There is apparently
              an ongoing issue with completion not providing all
              possible expansions, but since noone has yet provided a
              <tt>.bbdb</tt> file that demonstrates the problem, I've
              been unable to reproduce it.</li>
              </ul>
            </dd>

	<!-- this one's actually no longer an issue, I believe -->
			<dt>XEmacs is giving me an error about BBDB being already
			loaded.</dt>
			<dd>Updated: 25 February 2001 (David S. Goldman)<br>
			<br>
			Add the following before you call (bbdb-initialize):
			<pre>
  (unload-feature 'bbdb-autoloads t)
			</pre>
			This is fixed in the developer release, and should be
			available in the next stable release.<br><br></dd>

			<dt>I downloaded the developer release from CVS and I can't
			  build it.</dt>
			<dd>Updated: 25 February 2001<br>
			  <br>
			  The developer version from CVS does not include the
			  <tt>configure</tt> script; this should be generated using 
			  <tt>autoconf</tt>. The <tt>configure</tt> script is included
			  in the nightly tarball, so you can get it there if you
			  wish. Alternatively, it may be downloaded from the <a
			  href="http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/">BBDB Web Site</a>.<br>
			  <br>
			  The other problem you may have is that you're on a Win32
			  system with no support for Makefiles or scripts in
			  general. Your options are to install the Cygwin environment
			  (XXX there is a known issue with building under Cygwin XXX)
			  or to check the mailing list archives for a recent
			  <tt>make.bat</tt> file. The latter will probably migrate to
			  the BBDB bits section of CVS once the author has nailed it
			  down to his satisfaction.<br><br></dd>

            <dt>BBDB with Gnus is asking me if I want to update
              &lt;non-ASCII-name&gt; to &lt;non-ASCII-name&lt;</dt>
            <dd>Updated: 20 August 2005<br>
            <br>
			This should be (mostly) solved in CVS. If you encounter
			this, please submit a bug report.

            <dt>How do I get BBDB and supercite to play together?</dt>
            <dd>Updated: 28 June 2001<br>
            <br>
            (Thanks to Kevin Davidson, quoted here)
            <pre>
 Take a look at bbdb-sc.el that comes with BBDB.

 I found I also needed to patch supercite.el (up to at least version
 3.1 as supplied with Xemacs 20.3) otherwise it stops using your
 sc-preferred-attribution-list and starts using a broken default one.

 Patch here:

--- supercite.el.orig   Wed May  6 10:43:11 1998

*** 1250,1259 ****
              (setq attribution attrib
                    attriblist nil))
             ((listp attrib)
!             (setq attribution (eval attrib))
!             (if attribution
!                (setq attriblist nil)
!               (setq attriblist (cdr attriblist))))
             (t (error "%s did not evaluate to a string or list!"
                       "sc-attrib-selection-list"))
             )))
--- 1250,1257 ----
              (setq attribution attrib
                    attriblist nil))

!             (setq attribution (eval attrib)

             (t (error "%s did not evaluate to a string or list!"

             )))
            </pre><br><br>
            You might also need the following, from Sergei Pokrovsky:
<pre>
 '(sc-citation-nonnested-root-regexp "\\([-._]\\|\\w\\)+")
 '(sc-citation-root-regexp "\\([-._]\\|\\w\\)*")
</pre>

			<dt>How do I get my Pilot/Addressbook/Phone/Widget to sync

			Run screaming, waving hands in air.<br><br>
            Still here? Okay. This is a problem complicated by some
            basic differences in the respective tools' approach to
            addressbooks, <a
            href="http://www.mail-archive.com/bbdb-info%40xemacs.org/msg00571.html">neatly
            summarised in a message from Jamie
            Zawinski</a>. The solutions to date are at least three
            different <tt>bbdb-pilot.el</tt> files, <a
            href="http://home.rochester.rr.com/tsdeweese/SyncBBDB.html">SyncBBDB</a>
            and <a href="http://www.valente.de/aldo/palm/">SyncAB +
            BBDB</a>. The latter two are quite good, although
            personally I don't use anything to keep my bits in sync at
            present.</dd>
