;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Predefined configurations for `anything.el'
;;
;; For quick start, try `anything-for-files' to open files.
;;
;; To configure anything you should define anything command
;; with your favorite sources, like below:
;;
;; (defun my-anything ()
;;   (interactive)
;;   (anything-other-buffer
;;    '(anything-c-source-buffers
;;      anything-c-source-file-name-history
;;      anything-c-source-info-pages
;;      anything-c-source-info-elisp
;;      anything-c-source-man-pages
;;      anything-c-source-locate
;;      anything-c-source-emacs-commands)
;;    " *my-anything*"))
;;
;; Then type M-x my-anything to use sources.
;;
;; Defining own command is better than setup `anything-sources'
;; directly, because you can define multiple anything commands with
;; different sources. Each anything command should have own anything
;; buffer, because M-x anything-resume revives anything command.

Narrow the list by typing some pattern,
Multiple patterns are allowed by splitting by space.
Select with natural Emacs operations, choose with RET.

If you have any problems, press C-c C-x C-b!!
Feel free to send bug reports. I'll fix them.
The steps are described in the beginning of anything.el file.

== Basic Operations ==
C-p, Up: Previous Line
C-n, Down : Next Line
M-v, PageUp : Previous Page
C-v, PageDown : Next Page
Enter : Execute first (default) action / Select
M-< : First Line
M-> : Last Line
M-PageUp, C-M-S-v, C-M-y : Previous Page (other-window)
M-PageDown, C-M-v : Next Page (other-window)

Tab, C-i : Show action list
Left : Previous Source
Right, C-o : Next Source
C-k : Delete pattern
C-z : Persistent Action (Execute action with anything session kept)
C-c C-x C-b: Send a bug report

== Shortcuts For 2nd/3rd Action ==
\\[anything-select-2nd-action-or-end-of-line] : Execute 2nd Action (if the minibuffer cursor is at end of line)
\\[anything-select-3rd-action] : Execute 3rd Action

== Visible Marks ==
Visible marks store candidate. Some actions uses marked candidates.

\\[anything-toggle-visible-mark] : Toggle Visible Mark
\\[anything-prev-visible-mark] : Previous Mark
\\[anything-next-visible-mark] : Next Mark

== Miscellaneous Commands ==
\\[anything-toggle-resplit-window] : Toggle vertical/horizontal split anything window
\\[anything-quit-and-find-file] : Drop into `find-file'
\\[anything-delete-current-selection] : Delete Selected Item (visually)
\\[anything-kill-selection-and-quit] : Set Item Into the kill-ring And Quit
\\[anything-yank-selection] : Yank Selected Item Into Pattern
\\[anything-follow-mode] : Toggle Automatical Execution Of Persistent Action
\\[anything-force-update] : Recalculate And Redisplay Candidates

== Global Commands ==
\\<global-map>\\[anything-resume] revives last `anything' session.
It is very useful, so you should bind any key.

Single source is executed by \\[anything-call-source].

== Preconfigured `anything' ==
Preconfigured `anything' is commands that uses `anything' interface.
You can use them without configuration.
