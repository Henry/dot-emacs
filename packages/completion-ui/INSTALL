Obtaining
---------

The current version of the completion-ui package can be obtained from:

  http://www.dr-qubit.org/emacs.php

Developed and maintained by Toby Cubitt (toby-predictive@dr-qubit.org).




Installing
----------

To install the package, extract the files using

  tar -xvzf completion-ui.tar.gz

This will unpack the files into a new directory called
completion-ui/. Now byte-compile all the Lisp files and create the
required dictionaries by running

  make

in the completion-ui/ directory. If necessary, you can specify explicitly
where your Emacs resides with

  make EMACS=/path/to/emacs

Alternatively, if you cannot use the "make" utility, you can byte-compile
the Lisp files manually from within Emacs using `byte-compile-file' or
one of the other Emacs byte-compilation commands (see The Compilation
Functions, GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual). Personally, I like to use
`dired' when byte-compiling multiple files from within Emacs. (See
Operating on Files, GNU Emacs manual.)

Now copy the package files to a directory in your Emacs `load-path'
(you can view the current `load-path' from within Emacs using
"C-h v load-path").

Finally, add the following line to your .emacs file:

  (require 'completion-ui)

See the commentary at the top of the "completion-ui.el" file for an
overview of how to use it, or browse the `completion-ui' customization
group to discover the myriad customization options.
