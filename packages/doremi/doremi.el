;;
;;    Do Re Mi: Incremental change using arrow keys or mouse wheel.
;;
;; When you invoke Do Re Mi commands, you can then press and hold an
;; up/down arrow key, or turn the mouse wheel, to run up and down the
;; scale: do, re, mi,...
;;
;; Use the up/down arrow keys or the mouse wheel to:
;;
;;  - Change nearly any parameter incrementally (dynamically).
;;
;;  - Repeat an action.
;;
;;  - Cycle through a set of values, without changing anything (for
;;    example, to choose an item).  In this use, think of choosing
;;    from a menu.  This is similar to using a minibuffer history.
;;    The input choices can take the form of any Emacs-Lisp sequence
;;    (list, array, string, vector) - this sequence is converted to a
;;    circular structure (ring).
;;
;;  - Do just about anything: call a different function for each
;;    arrow.
;;
;; This works with numerical parameters that can be incremented and
;; decremented, and it works with parameters that can take on one of a
;; number of values.  In fact, it is even more general than that: you
;; can use it to associate nearly any function or pair of functions
;; with the arrow keys and the mouse wheel.
;;
;; By default, the up and down arrow keys are used, but any other keys
;; may be used instead.  Mouse wheel movements are recognized for
;; Emacs 20 and Emacs 21 (using library `mwheel.el').  `mouse-2'
;; presses are ignored, so that they won't interfere with rotating the
;; wheel.
;;
;; See the doc string for function `doremi' for more information.
;;
;; Code defining a few example commands is included here (but
;; commented out), so you can see how to use this.  For more examples
;; of using function `doremi', see files `doremi-frm.el' and
;; `doremi-cmd.el'.
;;
;; This library uses library `ring+.el', which provides extensions to
;; the standard library `ring.el' to let you manipulate circular
;; structures.
;;
;;
;;  Non-interactive functions defined here:
;;
;;    `doremi', `doremi-intersection', `doremi-limit',
;;    `doremi-set-new-value', `doremi-wrap'.
;;
;;  User options (variables) defined here:
;;
;;    `doremi-boost-down-keys', `doremi-boost-scale-factor',
;;    `doremi-boost-up-keys', `doremi-down-keys', `doremi-up-keys'.
;;
;;  Add this to your initialization file (~/.emacs or ~/_emacs):
;;
;;    (require 'doremi)
;;
;;  See also these related libraries that make use of `doremi':
;;
;;    `doremi-frm.el' - Incrementally adjust frame properties.
;;    `doremi-cmd.el' - Other Do Re Mi commands.
;;    `doremi-mac.el' - Macro to define Do Re Mi commands and
;;                      automatically add them to Do Re Mi menu.
;;
;;  This has been tested on GNU Emacs 20, 21, and 22 on MS Windows.
;;
;;
;; TO DO?:
;;
;;   - Replace `boost-*' keys by test for modifiers (as for wheel).
;;   - Combine with customize.  That is, have customize buffers use
;;     Do Re Mi commands to defined numeric or enumeration values.
;;   - Provide buttons (menu items) in menus that act like up & down
;;     arrows.

;;; Non-Interactive Functions

(defun doremi (setter-fn init-val incr &optional growth-fn enum allow-new-p)
  "Use arrow keys and/or mouse wheel to adjust some parameter.

Variables `doremi-up-keys' and `doremi-down-keys' are variables that
you can assign to any key sequences.  You can use these keys or the
mouse wheel to dynamically adjust any parameter.  The keys can be held
down for continual adjustment.

Example parameters include background color and font size, but a
parameter can be anything that is adjustable in any of these ways:
 * A numerical parameter that can be incremented or decremented, such
   as frame height.
 * A parameter that can take on one of several values (an enumerated
   choice), such as a frame background color.
 * A parameter that has an associated function to change its value
   incrementally.

SETTER-FN is a function that adjusts the parameter.  Two forms:
 1) It takes a value as argument and sets the parameter to this value.
 2) It is a \"growth\" function, which takes an increment as argument
    and incrementally adjusts the value of the parameter.

 Note that \"growth\" function really means, here, that the function
 takes an increment as argument and does the incrementation (or
 whatever) itself.  It is contrasted with an absolute SETTER-FN that
 just uses a value that is incremented by `doremi'.  The difference is
 which function does the incrementing, SETTER-FN or `doremi'.

 In case #1, the new parameter value _must_ be returned by SETTER-FN.
 In case #2, the new parameter value should be returned by SETTER-FN,
             so that it can be echoed to the user.

INIT-VAL is the initial value for adjustment.  In the case of an
 incremental growth function (case #2), this is ignored.

INCR is an adjustment increment.
 For an absolute SETTER-FN (#1), this is applied to INIT-VAL before
     calling the function.  If ENUM is non-nil, then INCR is ignored.
 For an incremental growth function, this is passed to the function.

INCR can be a number or a list of numbers.  When it is a list of
numbers, each is incremented or decremented (and possibly boosted by
`doremi-boost-scale-factor' - see below).

If GROWTH-FN is non-nil, then SETTER-FN is an incremental growth
  function (case #2), and it is called with INCR as its only argument.
If GROWTH-FN is a function, then it is used as an alternative growth
  function.  In this case, SETTER-FN is called for `doremi-up-keys'
  and GROWTH-FN is called for `doremi-down-keys' (mouse wheel is
  similar).

ENUM is a choice-enumeration sequence (list, array, string...).
  If ENUM is non-nil, then it is converted to a ring (circular
  structure), and `doremi-up-keys' and `doremi-down-keys' set the
  parameter to `ring-next' and `ring-previous' values, respectively.

If ENUM is non-nil, then ALLOW-NEW-P defines what happens if INIT-VAL
is not a member of ENUM.  If ALLOW-NEW-P is nil, then an error is
raised.  If non-nil, then INIT-VAL is added (to the ring created from
ENUM).  If the symbol `extend', then if the ring is full it is
extended to include INIT-VAL; other non-nil values cause the oldest
item in a full ring to be dropped.

For numerical parameters (not enumerated choices), there are actually
two levels of incrementation.  For faster incrementation, you can use
`doremi-boost-up-keys' and `doremi-boost-down-keys', or you can use
any keyboard modifier(s) (Shift, Meta, Control...) with the mouse
wheel.  Incrementation is then `doremi-boost-scale-factor' times
faster.

For examples of using `doremi', see the source code of libraries
`doremi.el', `doremi-frm.el', and `doremi-cmd.el'."
