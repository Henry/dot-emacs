;;; eulisp-mode-el -- Major mode for editing EuLisp files
;;
;; Author: Henry G. Weller <hweller0@gmail.com>
;; Maintainer: Henry G. Weller

;; Created: Wed Aug 19 23:24:17 2009 (+0100)
;; Version: 0.6
;; Last-Updated: Tue Aug 24 16:31:00 2010 (+0100)
;;           By: Henry G. Weller
;;     Update #: 8
;; URL: https://github.com/Henry/EuLisp/blob/master/emacs/eulisp-mode.el
;; Keywords: EuLisp major-mode
;; Compatibility: GNU Emacs 23.x (may work with earlier versions)
;;
;; This file is NOT part of Emacs.
;;
;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The major mode for editing EuLisp code.
;;
;; Based heavily on lisp-mode and scheme-mode with inspiration from font-lock,
;; python-mode and simula-mode supplied with emacs-23 and a couple of ideas from
;; clojure-mode.
;;
;; Two commenting styles are supported:
;;
;;     ; single-line comments
;;     #; (statement comments)
;;
;; Note than the eulisp-font-lock-keywords were obtained from the Youtoo
;; Bindings.txt file not from the EuLisp definition and hence contain many
;; keywords not in the definition.  This will be rectified in due course.
;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; Change log:
;;
;; Version 0.1
;; * Initial release.
;; Version 0.2
;; * Added support for s-expression comments.
;; Version 0.3
;; * Added special indentation handling for EuLisp infix symbols defined in
;;   `eulisp-special-symbol-indent-regexp' e.g. `->' which if on new line are
;;   indented one level."
;; Version 0.4
;; * Added special indentation handling for forms for which all but the last
;;   specified number of arguments should be indented.  This is useful for the
;;   EuLisp `let' in which the last argument is special.
;; * Added indentation of the arguments in a function call form.
;; * Split `define' and 'datatype' font-locking so that the function and type
;;   names can have different fonts.
;; * Changed the default indentation style of `if' to indent the condition and
;;   execution statements the same amount.
;; Version 0.5
;; * Updated predicates.
;; Version 0.6
;; * Improved indentation rule:
;;     + default indentation for defmodule now 0;
;;     + defmodule directives list now indented 1 level;
;;     + `defun' indentation added for Eu2C-specific defining forms.

the body of the expression.  A line in the expression is indented
according to whether the first argument on it is distinguished or
not.  If the argument is part of the body, the line is indented
`lisp-body-indent' more columns than the open-parenthesis
starting the containing expression.  If the argument is
distinguished and is either the first or second argument, it is
indented _twice_ that many extra columns.  If the argument is
distinguished and not the first or second argument, the line uses
the standard pattern.")

     (symbol :tag "SYMBOL should be a function name; that
function is called to calculate the indentation of a line within
this expression.  The function receives two arguments:

STATE
    The value returned by `parse-partial-sexp' (a Lisp
    primitive for indentation and nesting computation) when it
    parses up to the beginning of this line.

POS
    The position at which the line being indented begins.

It should return either a number, which is the number of columns
of indentation for that line, or a list whose car is such a
number.  The difference between returning a number and returning
a list is that a number says that all following lines at the same
nesting level should be indented just like this one; a list says
that following lines might call for different indentations.  This
makes a difference when the indentation is being computed by
`C-M-q'; if the value is a number, `C-M-q' need not recalculate
indentation for the following lines until the end of the list."))))
