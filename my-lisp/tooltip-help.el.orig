;;; Commentary:

;; F1 is a useless key on my keyboard, because I don't use it in
;; Emacs, so I thought I bound some kind of help function on it.
;;
;; I thought some kind of help which is less intrusive than the
;; default one (doesn't open a new window, frame, etc.) would be
;; useful, so I made one using tooltips.
;;
;; When using in a Lisp program the tooltip is displayed without
;; osbcuring the position of the cursor and it is dismissed
;; automatically when the user continues typing, so it doesn't disrupt
;; the current window configuration like the current help does.
;;
;; How it works:
;;
;; If the cursor is ON a symbol then help is shown for that symbol.
;;
;; If the cursor is after or before a symbol then the function symbol
;; belonging to the containing sexp is used. If no such symbol is
;; found then a nearby symbol is tried.
;;
;; If the symbol has both function and variable bindings then both of
;; them are shown together in the tooltip.
;;
;; Bind to suitable key e.g.:
;;
;;   (global-set-key [f1] 'th-show-help)
;;
;; Support can be added by creating a function with a name like this:
;;
;;   th-<major-mode>-handler
;;
;; Currently only Emacs lisp mode is supported.
;; So a possible more restrictive binding:
;;
;;   (define-key emacs-lisp-mode-map [f1] 'th-show-help)
;;
;; Tested on Gnu Emacs 21 and 23.

;;; Change log:

;; Version 0.2
;; * Simplified the code, removing the argument highlighting which
;;   caused problems and didn't apparently work.
;; * Simplified the logic to find the nearest symbol to the point.
;; * Improved the logic for looking-up function symbols.
;; * Changed the tooltip positioning code to work more reliably on
;;   GNU Emacs 23, this may not work for 21.  (Changes by Henry Weller)
